LWKD is a weekly newsletter summarizing code activity in the Kubernetes project: merges, PRs, deprecations, version updates, release schedules, and the weekly community meeting.  It does not cover events or news in the Kubernetes ecosystem, as our sister publication [KubeWeekly](https://kubeweekly.com/) does a great job of handling those.

LWKD is the product of [contributors from the Kubernetes Project](/authors).  It is not an official publication of the CNCF or the project.  If you're interested in helping with LWKD, see our [README](https://github.com/lwkd/lwkd.github.io).  You can also contact us at lwkd@lwkd.info.

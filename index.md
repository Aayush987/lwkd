# Last Week In Kubernetes Development

Stay up-to-date on Kubernetes development in 15 minutes a week.

LWKD is a weekly newsletter summarizing code activity in the Kubernetes project: merges, PRs, deprecations, version updates, release schedules, and the weekly community meeting.  It does not cover events or news in the Kubernetes ecosystem, as our sister publication [KubeWeekly](https://kubeweekly.com/) does a great job of handling those.

LWKD is the product of contributors from the Kubernetes Project.  It is not an official publication of the CNCF or the project.  If you're interested in helping with LWKD, see our [README](https://github.com/lwkd/lwkd.github.io).

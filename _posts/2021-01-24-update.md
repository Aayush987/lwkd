## Developer News

Davanum Srinivas has proposed [removing golint verification](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98063) because of the amount of overhead for contributors & reviewers.

Philippe Martin [has overhauled/updated](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/04/gsod-2020-improving-api-reference-experience/) our [API reference Docs](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/4v4zQTdWOlo) for Google Summer of Docs.

[kube-state-metrics project](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/) is looking for new maintainers and contributors, if you are interested in contributing please reach out to brancz (Frederic Branczyk) or lili (Lili Cosic) on Kubernetes slack. They have a few [help wanted issues as well](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

[PodUtils](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/pod-utilities.md#writing-a-prowjob-that-uses-pod-utilities) for Kubernetes testing have been [updated to support all metrics](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/4ijGaCCHVxQ), which means that you should use them for your tests in the future.  Test-infra has also [created an Overview screen](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/Xy4RZAJ_u4E) in TestGrid.

SIG-ContribEx chair Jorge Castro [is stepping down](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/TYwMb3lbuyE), likely to be replaced by Alison Dowdney.

There will be no January Community Meeting, because of an error with the Kubernetes public calendar.  See you in February!

## Featured PRs


## Other Merges

* Structured log migration tally: [audit policy](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98252), [APIserver endpoints](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98093), [Windows proxy](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97941)
* No more [panic in the Kubelet](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98200)
* Delete [static pods cleanly](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98103)
* Make inter-pod affinity affect scheduling more [by broadening the score range](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98096)
* `kubectl describe` [will now indent two spaces](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97946) for Resources, and `--dry-run=client` [acknowledges namespaces](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97492)
* Sort ReplicaSets by [revision, not timestamp](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97407) during cleanup
* Wanna disable volume stats?  [Set `--volume-stats-agg-period` to -1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96675)
* Fix race condition in shutting down EventRecorders, by [having them use select instead of spawning new goroutines](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95664)

## Deprecated

* API ExportOptions, deprecated a year ago, [are removed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98312) and queries that include them will get a 400
* Since `kubectl debug` is GA, [`kubectl alpha debug` is going away](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98111), incidentally [removing the last alpha command](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97523), meaning it's time for *you* to develop a new kubectl command

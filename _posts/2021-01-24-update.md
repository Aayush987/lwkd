## Developer News

Davanum Srinivas has proposed [removing golint verification](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98063) because of the amount of overhead for contributors & reviewers.

[kube-state-metrics project](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/) is looking for new maintainers and contributors, if you are interested in contributing please reach out to brancz (Frederic Branczyk) or lili (Lili Cosic) on Kubernetes slack. They have a few [help wanted issues as well](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

[PodUtils](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/pod-utilities.md#writing-a-prowjob-that-uses-pod-utilities) for Kubernetes testing have been [updated to support all metrics](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/4ijGaCCHVxQ), which means that you should use them for your tests in the future.  Test-infra has also [created an Overview screen](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/Xy4RZAJ_u4E) in TestGrid.

SIG-ContribEx chair Jorge Castro [is stepping down](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/TYwMb3lbuyE), likely to be replaced by Alison Dowdney.

There will be no January Community Meeting, because of an error with the Kubernetes public calendar.  See you in February!

## Developer News

Kube-deploy [has been archived](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/1888), since it was never actually built and has been superceded.  We got an [image builder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder) out of it though.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Freeze Exceptions due June 1**

We are now in Enhancements Freeze, which means that you should be working on making your filed Features a reality, for contribution one month from now. Also, [1.19.0-beta.0 is published](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.19.md/#v1190-beta0), so please test!

Release Engineering pushed out updates [1.18.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md/#v1183), [1.17.6](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.17.md/#v1176), and [1.16.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.16.md#v11610) last week.  This is a "bug fix" release, so its urgency depends on whether or not you're already hitting some of the bugs.

## Other Merges

* [Use a "distroless" image](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91171) for etcd, including the bash-static utility; this may cause some issues for image scanners

* kubelet flag `--seccomp-profile-root` [moves to the config file](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91182)
* `kubectl create secret docker-registry` [supports `--from-file`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90960)
* `kubectl create --dryrun` [stops ignoring namespaces](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90502)

## Version Updates

* [kube-addon-manager to v9.1.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91240) in 1.19
* v1.18 to [debian-base:v2.1.0 and iptables:v12.1.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90863) to patch IPTables security hole

## Developer News

Now that [Pod Security](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/) is a thing, E2E tests [will be run under the restricted pod security level](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106454).  If this breaks your tests, you may need to [request a different level](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-testing/e2e-tests.md#pod-security-admission).  

You also might need to [rebase to master](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/8x3KZEGxTx0) to pick up changes introduced for golang 1.18.

Etcd [needs more reviewers/maintainers](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/steering/c/e-O-tVSCJOk).  If you have experience with the Etcd code, but have moved on to other things, consider coming back to help out the project.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Freeze, March 29th/30th**

[Code Freeze is coming](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/U1mzQqSVIQM). You should have everything approved/LGTMed by tommorrow (6pm Pacific/1am UTC), or punt it to 1.25. [Exceptions](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md) are possible, but are not always granted.

[Master Blocking](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking) is definitely better than last week, with just four flaky jobs -- kudos to Jordan Liggit and Eddie Zane for [diagnosing the skew test failure](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108307).

## Developer News

There are two outstanding security vulns in Kubernetes components, one in [in kube-controller-manager](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/yoCzkO9e88c), and one in a [popular CNI component](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/5U7F1QuPccA) used in several overlay networks.  Both issues have been patched in the most recent releases.

[The Annual Patch Support discussion continues](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/tOe2UFB_weQ); currently folks are debating the impact of dependency support, particularly golang and etcd. Also, [node feature discovery](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery/releases/tag/v0.6.0) has advanced this week.

## Meeting Summary

The [public Steering Committee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qazwMIHGeF3iUh5xMJIJ6PDr-S3bNkT8tNLRkSiOkOU/edit#) meeting was yesterday.  They discussed preparing for the 2020 SC election and a number of financial matters.

## Featured PRs


## Other Merges

* `kubectl run` [ditches all generators](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/87077), now just runs pods; this also involves deprecating a bunch of flags and may break your scripts; [`kubectl create deployment --port`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91113) added to replace one use case
* component-base [gets a --logging-format flag](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89683) to support the new klog formats
* Metric types [bounded to a known list](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89451)
* Metric `scheduler_total_preemption_attempts` [renamed to](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91448) `scheduler_preemption_attempts_total` for consistency
* Our CLI will [now error out](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91349) on "false flags" that use non-ASCII dashes
* kubelet [`--seccomp-profile-root`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91182), [`--enable-server` and `--provider-id`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90494) moved to config file; will get removed in a couple of versions
* Prevent [etcd-removal catch-22](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91145) in `kubeadm reset`
* Take [the number of images into account](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91138) for node topology
* Target specific AWS Loadbalancer nodes [using annotations](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90943)

## Promotions

* * Scheduler config was [promoted to beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91420), including a new [PostFilter API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91547) added to the Scheduler config API, refactoring how preemption works
* [Azure Disk migration to beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90896)

## Deprecated

* [`kubectl run` generator flags](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/87077)
* [`DynamicAuditing` alpha feature gate](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91502) has been removed, mostly because [sig-auth decided that audit webhooks are better](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-sig-auth/aV_nXpa5uWU)
* No more [`kubectl apply --server-dry-run`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91308) because Dry Run is now GA and doesn't require an extra flag

## Version Updates

* [CNI to v0.8.6](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91370) on all versions
* [debian-hyperkube-base to v1.0.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91476) in testing

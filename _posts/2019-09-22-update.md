## Developer News

[Kubernetes 1.16](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.16.md) came out last week!

Don't forget that [we removed a bunch of deprecated APIs](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/) in this release, which may break things for you, [especially Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6374).  Yes, you're gonna have to update your charts.

While the [blog](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/09/18/kubernetes-1-16-release-announcement/) has the top new features, let's explore some less-hyped 1.16 features that you may nonetheless care about:

* **Pod Spread Constraints**: [This alpha feature](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-scheduling/20190221-even-pods-spreading.md) lets you fine-tune the scheduler for specific applications, such as the common case of "try to get the pods on as many different nodes as possible," a popular requirement for databases.
* **RuntimeClasses**: this [alpha option for nodes and pods](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/78484), with [scheduling support](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80825), lets you pick container runtimes for special purpose containers that need to run GPUs, VMs, or similar.  Also applies [PodOverhead](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/78484).
* **kubeadm DualStack**: clusters installed with kubeadm can now get [DualStack support](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80145), making [IPv6-aware clusters](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/) more of a reality for a lot of users.
* **WatchBookmarks**: now on by default, allowing [bookmark events](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/20190206-watch-bookmark.md) to greatly reduce overall watch traffic for the API server and thus improve scalability.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.17 Release Cycle Begins, Sept. 23**

Yes, 1.17 has already begun, with Guinevere Saenger at the helm.  Interested in being on the release team?  [Join as a shadow](https://forms.gle/3rePTvKbLF96p6zMA).  Applications open until the 25th, so don't dawdle.

Patch release 1.16.1 is expected to be out on the 27th, mostly to fix [AddHealthChecks](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82761) and [TokenCleaner](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82887).

## Other Merges

* [Drop monitoring of firewalld](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81517) because it was causing race conditions in IPtables.  The change depends on firewalld (or anything else) flushing IPtables and not deleting entries, so if you're deleting entries you may find that kube-proxy does not recover automatically (so cut it out already, jeez)
* [Don't let the scheduler put the dashboard on Windows nodes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82975), because it crashes there
* [Don't run kube-proxy on Windows either](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82959) since it needs to run as a Windows service
* Scheduling framework's PluginContext [can be Cloned](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82951), and it [passes full NodeInfo](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82842) in the FilterAPI
* We may be [still leaking FDs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82873), so maybe prevent that
* Don't [panic the scheduler with PodAffinity](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82841)
* Stop [requerying and rewriting PV labels](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82830) for dynamic PVs
* Fix [Docker panic](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82508) in DualStack mode
* Change the [CNI plugin timeout](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/71653) to reflect Docker's own network timeout

## Deprecated

* Remove [several feature flags](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82472) for features that went GA a while ago

## Version Updates

* [metrics-server to v0.3.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/83015)

## Developer News

Deprecated registry k8s.gcr.io [has been redirected](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/03/10/image-registry-redirect/) to registry.k8s.io.  This may cause issues with some builds and/or deployments, so check yours for image pull errors. Please update your infrastructure and code to use the new registry, as much as you can.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Docs due March 21; Test Freeze, March 22**

We are in Code Freeze.  Please fix any reported test failures or bugs (urgently).  Your final enhancement documentation is due for editing Tuesday, and on Wednesday they'll halt all changes to tests. The release team is also drafting the release notes and the release blog.

Patch releases [1.26.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md), [1.25.8](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md), [1.24.12](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md) are available.  Version 1.23 is now **EOL**, and 1.23.17 was the last patch release for that version.

Signing the images for this month's patch releases [did not go well](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/MwSx761slM0), so you can't yet enforce signing on all images via cosign.  Next month, hopefully.

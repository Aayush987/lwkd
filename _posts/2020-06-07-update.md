## Developer News

Many SIGs and other parts of the community shut down last week in honor of the Black Lives Matter protests.  So, it's a quiet week for LWKD.

The Infrastructure working group is getting ready to retry the swap of the `k8s.gcr.io` facade name to point at the community-managed `gcr.io/k8s-artifacts-prod` project. This was tried once before in April, however some internal issues within Google forced a rollback. The plan is to run the swap again on June 22nd, after the next round of patch releases. No user-visible impact is expected, but if anything is missed please contact the `#wg-k8s-infra` Slack channel or the [wg-k8s-infra mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/kubernetes-wg-k8s-infra).

One of last week's posted [security vulnerabilities](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8555) was discovered by Brice Augras and Christophe Hauquiert and reported through [the Bug Bounty program](https://hackerone.com/kubernetes).  Didn't know we had one?  Well we do, and this is what it's for.  Go forth and find bugs.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Begin docs PRs, June 12th**

You have until the end of this week to get draft/outline documentation for your new features submitted to SIG-docs.  Also, Code Freeze Is Coming on June 25th.

[1.19.0-beta.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.19.md/#v1190-beta1) is out for testing.

Cherry-pick PRs for all supported versions are due June 12th for a June 17th update release.

## Featured PRs

### [#91685: CertificateSigningRequest v1 API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91685)

The CSR API saw two big updates this week. First the final [v1beta1 features](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90191) were completed, adding better error signaling and general status management improvements. Then the v1 version was added with some backwards-incompatible improvements. The main user-facing changes are that `signerName` and `usages` are both required in v1 and better validated. V1 also solidifies a lot of status management improvements into the schema itself. Together these lay a great foundation for the future of the CSR API.

### [#91883: Remove ResourceLimitsPriorityFunction feature gate in the scheduler](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91883)

A long-time alpha feature, ResourceLimitsPriorityFunction never really found a champion to push towards GA and so has been removed. If this was somehow critical to your scheduler plans, consider writing a plugin or extender instead.

## Community Meeting Summary


## Release Schedule


## Featured PRs

### [#75595: Add preliminary go module instructions to client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75595)

While `dep` and Bazel are still deeply entrenched in our ecosystem, Go 1.11 modules are starting to get more traction. This PR adds some basic steps to follow to use client-go as a dependency through the modules system. This is far from final; if you're going to use this in anything serious, it would be a good idea to throw a watch on [#74877](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/74877) which will follow up with much more goodness. Steps towards a `dep`-less future!

### [#72179: Migrate the controller to use TokenRequest and rotate token periodically](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/72179)

The ServiceAccount controller has been switched over to the standard TokenRequest API rather than the old, homegrown system. This should improve standardization for token management. [todo what are the ramifications of this change? I've reached out to sig-auth for clarification]

### [#75531: New staging repository for cri-api](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75531)

For anyone working on CRI implementations or related code, there will now be a `k8s.io/cri-api` library to import from. As with all staging repos, this is replicated automatically from the `k/k` repo, but you can get faster compile times and smaller binaries by using it.

### [test-infra#11979: Add support for rebase and merge override labels](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/11979)

More relevant to other projects and teams deploying Prow themselves than for contributors to `k/k` itself, Tide will now support a per-PR override for the merge type used. You can specify that a given PR should be squashed or merged with individual commits, no matter what the project default is.

### [community#3370: Updates to SIG Cloud Provider Charter](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/3370)

If you're involved with any of the cloud SIGs, hopefully you've already seen this but for the rest of us: change is in the cloudy air! The various cloud provider SIGs are unifying under a shared SIG Cloud Provider banner to better align their efforts and hopefully improve cooperation between the major vendors.

### [website#13340: Init German translation](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/13340)

And finally a simple but happy-making PR, our basic documentation is now available in German! Our community gets bigger every day and with that comes more translations. Awesome work by the website team getting this initial batch of translations done.

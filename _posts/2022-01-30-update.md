## Developer News

The main [cert-manager repo](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) will be migrating to [cert-manager/cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager) on Feb. 2.  If you build cert-manager, you will need to update the repo path in your code. Container images and helm charts will not move.

Jordan Liggit [updated](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/31389) the [Kubernetes deprecation policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/) to reflect actual practice.  The new policy makes it clear that Kubernetes does not deprecate Stable APIs within a major version.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, Feb. 3**

[Enhancements Freeze](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/usQ00XR6eYs) is only a few days away.  If you're planning a significant feature for 1.24, it should be [on the tracking spreadsheet](https://bit.ly/k8s124-enhancements).  The [CI Signal Report](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/G5WkPuOPy14) documents a few flakes.

Release Engineering published an [emergency extra update](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md) to 1.23 (1.23.3) last week to fix a regression. Users who [use CRDs that rely on `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107688) should avoid 1.23.0-2, or update to 1.23.3 immediately.

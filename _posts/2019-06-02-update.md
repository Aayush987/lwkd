We're back!  After a hiatus for conference travel, LWKD returns this week with your usual slushball of information about what's happening in the land of cloud-natively hacking.

**Security Alert**: kubelet v1.13.6 and v1.14.2 have a [security regression](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/pDqE2kAnMVY).  You should downgrade to the prior patch release, set RunAsUser, or upgrade to the patch versions coming out later this week.

## Developer News

If you are using TravisCI with your repo, you need to remove it, since [Prow and Tide can't interact with it anymore](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/z4yDUNMyW_0).  This includes a long list of repos that are about to stop merging, so please fix. Further, merge commits will now [be blocked](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/x88DyA-CfOI) from Kubernetes/Kubernetes.

On the nice side, Prow now [checks your Github status](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/bXHK8l3D6l0) before assigning reviews to you.

Several SIGs have started doing day-long cleanups where they go through their backlogs of issues and PRs to see what can be closed.  See SIG mailing lists to join one.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: All enhancements should have Docs patches ready to review today, June 4th.  Beta.2 comes out June 5.**

Version 1.15 is currently in [Code Freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.15).  The upcoming release has 27 enhancements, one of which may not make it. CI Signal status is yellow, and 20 PRs are waiting to be merged, so please review and fix those tests!

There is now a [separate repo for Release Notes tooling](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/release-notes). If you have opinions about the [Release Notes Website](https://relnotes.k8s.io/), please [speak up via the survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/X772P2Z).

Versions [v1.14.3](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/U1K9isWxs24) and [v1.13.7](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/euTY0KxoPlI) will be released June 6th, and fix the reported security issue.  Version [1.12.9](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/2ukrlyDAzKY) was released May 29th.

## Developer News

Test-Infra has published new Velodrome charts for Test Job Health, in order for contributors all over the project to get on top of making their blocking jobs stable and reliable.  This includes [Release Blocking Jobs](http://velodrome.k8s.io/dashboard/db/job-health-release-blocking?orgId=1), [Merge Blocking Jobs](http://velodrome.k8s.io/dashboard/db/job-health-merge-blocking?orgId=1), and [flake rates](http://velodrome.k8s.io/dashboard/db/job-health-release-blocking?panelId=2&fullscreen&orgId=1) for the various jobs.  Currently the TextPreemptWithPermitPlugin is the flakiest test, so if that's yours, check into it.

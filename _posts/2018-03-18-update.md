There was no LWKD issue last week due to 1.10 release prep.  Which means you missed nothing, because we're in [code freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.10/release-1.10.md), which means all of the merges are for 1.10 features and bug fixes.  We'll detail those from the last 2 weeks, below.

## Community Meeting Summary

The [Community Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VQDIAB0OqiSjIHI8AWMvSdceWhnz56jNpZrLs6o7NJY) demo this week was [Kuberhealthy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tL80i7VTBUlDs5KXy7TBZcHVX45lFST2cmmE3oyjYWc), a tool by Comcast to monitor the "health" of Kubernetes clusters using both passive monitoring and active probing, which is unfortunately not yet generally available.  SIG Auth delivered an [update](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wyOkDwRDQetjTBeaPbJfkt1M8f_q3nxN5ta5v_OTfzA) coverign their features for 1.10, specifically Pod Security Policies, Advanced Auditing, the TokenRequest API, and client-go authentication providers.  As Auth is the security SIG, they are considering creating a bug bounty to find security issues in Kube.  SIG Instrumentation introduced the External Metrics API for integrating 3rd party services, and plans to graduate the Metrics API and Custom Metrics API to beta and eventually GA, deprecating Heapster in the process.  They are working on instrumentation API security with SIG-Auth, and thinking about a historical metrics API and Kubelet metrics.

Announcements: you can [register](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2018/co-located-events/kubernetes-contributor-summit/) for the Copenhagen Contributor Summit. [Office Hours](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/events/office-hours.md) are on Wednesday, we need users and volunteers to attend.

## Release Schedule

Version 1.10 release [is delayed](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.10/release-1.10.md), due to the prior week's [security release](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.9.md/#v194) and difficult [scalability](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/60589) and [downgrade compatibility](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/60764) issues.  As such, Code Freeze will end later today (Monday), and the actual release is now planned for March 26th.  We are looking for a new [release lead](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/release-process-documentation/release-team-guides/release-lead.md) (and other team members) for 1.11.

Merges for the last 2 weeks are all to finish features and fix bugs in 1.10.  Only the most significant are included below.  Excluded are the many fixes to tests in order to get the boards green, and the many cherry-picks to backport fixes.

## About That Security Release

Versions of Kubernetes prior to 1.9.4/1.8.9/1.7.14 allowed hostile users to hack [subpath volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#using-subpath) mounts [to access any file on the host system](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/60813).  Users on older versions should upgrade as soon as possible.  However, upgrading users may need to manually [disable hostPath volumes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/61043) on their clusters.  This has been followed by [other](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61284) [tweaks](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/61283) to subpath volume permissions, so if you use subpaths, look out for additional required upgrades.

## Feature Work

* [Scheduling Daemonsets using the scheduler](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/548) (instead of overriding it) is [now committed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59862), including the new [unschedulable taint](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61161) and will be alpha in 1.10.
* Logging [deletion of Statefulset Pods](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60579) was increased.
* The cache now uses [Pod UIDs as keys](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61069) instead of name/namespace.

## Deprecated

* The deprecated [--mode switch for GCE](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61203) has been purged from the Kubernetes code.  This was supposed to have been done a year ago, when we first got the deprecation warning.  Ooops.

## Version Updates

* Etcd was updated to 3.1.12, then [rolled back to 3.1.11](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60891) then upgraded to [3.1.12 again](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60998) as part of troubleshooting performance issues.
* [cadvisor to 0.29.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60867)
* [fluentd-gcp-scaler to 0.2.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61225)
* [ingress glbc image to 1.0.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61302)

## Other Merges

* Fixed two race conditions [endpoint deletion](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60856) and [pod deletion](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61071).
* Subpath volumes can [be used with ConfigMap and Secrets again](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61080).
* [Kubectl command completion](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61129) now works with zsh.
* Prevented [garbage collector stalls](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61201) when the GC runs out of resources.

## Graph of the Week

![graph of documentation PR response times](/2018/images/sig-docs-response-times.png)

[Zach Corleissen](https://github.com/zacharysarah) shared a [graph of documentation pull request response times](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/44/time-metrics?orgId=1&var-period=w&var-repogroup_name=Docs&var-repogroup=docs&var-apichange=All&var-size_name=All&var-size=all&var-full_name=Kubernetes).  Seeing this graph in DevStats helped alleviate SIG-Docs anxiety about their response times, but showing that it was still less than 4 days.  Prow automation had helped a lot with this.

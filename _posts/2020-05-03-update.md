## Developer News

The Production Readiness WG wants to [add some production-ready questions](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1620) to the KEP format, so that new features have to think about lifecycle and maturation, as well as things like monitoring and scalability.

SIG-Storage has added the [Drivers Announce list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!aboutgroup/container-storage-interface-drivers-announce) so that storage driver authors can keep up on changes to the API and list of available drivers.  

## Meeting Summary

The [May 4th Steering Committee meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qazwMIHGeF3iUh5xMJIJ6PDr-S3bNkT8tNLRkSiOkOU/edit#) started with a discussion about Paris's [SIG/WG health check proposal](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/153).  After a lot of discussion around SIG lead workload, the SC decided to try this with the Working Groups first, and let SIGs do it if they want to.  This led to a discussion of the need to assign new SC liaisons for each SIG, and what the liaisons are supposed to do.

The SC asked the CNCF for help [establising an account with DigitalOcean for e2e testing](https://github.com/kubernetes/funding/issues/9).  They discussed trying to [finalize the definition](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/pull/114) of "project member," confusing because the requirements for submitting a PR and for voting in elections are different.  The CNCF let the SC know [they have a formal process for travel funding scholarship evaluation now](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/travel_funding.md), although that's rather academic in the current environment.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancement Freeze, May 19th**

[Enhancements need to be in soon](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/G5iIu3FrRTY), which means getting your KEPs in order.  Remember the 1.19 release will have an extended schedule, so what do you think you can get done by June 25?

[Patch releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/patch-releases.md) for all supported versions are currently planned for May 20th, with a cherry-pick deadline of May 15th.  Note that "supported versions" no longer includes 1.15, so if you're on that maybe time to upgrade.

## Deprecated

Many old beta versions of APIs are going to be deprecated in 1.19, with planned removal in 1.22.  This will make 1.22 a breaking release for lots of folks, so you've been warned now.

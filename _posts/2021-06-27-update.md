## Developer News

The [Community Annual Report](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/06/28/announcing-kubernetes-community-group-annual-reports/) is out.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Freeze, July 8th**

Code Freeze is staring [in a little over a week](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/UJDpGmOQTcA), which means it's time to merge those enhancements or punt them to 1.23.  Also, don't forget that Docs wants your placeholder PRs on July 9th. There's just [one open critical-urgent bug](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/100914) in 1.22 right now, so if you know the code, maybe help close it?

Cherry-picks for the next patch release are due July 12th.

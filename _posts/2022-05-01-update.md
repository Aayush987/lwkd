## Developer News

We forgot to include the [community meeting](http://bit.ly/k8scommunity) in the previous blog, so here are some pointers from the April's edition:

We might see a [separation in the tech lead role](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5890) as it is hard to figure out between TL and chairs in some areas whose approval is needed or who’s responsible for what. For this we are looking forward to remove the default roll-up TL into chair role and set the boundaries.

Another concern was raised on the [terms of chairs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5886). The proposed solution to this was to establish 2 year term with a previlege to step down from the position by doing the needful.

We were also informed about the [upcoming annual reports](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/238) which is going to be located in the same place as last year. We might see some changes in order to make it better.

At last there was a long conversation on how to avoid closing the bug issues. The major concern here was that there are some bug issues that don’t get prioritized and were closed by the bot though they were serious bugs. One approach solving this issue could be to not to close those issues with triage/accepted label in kubernetes/kubernetes repository.

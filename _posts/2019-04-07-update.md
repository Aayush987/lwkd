## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.15 Release Cycle begins April 8**

The new release cycle has begun, and the [release team is being staffed up](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/545). Release Lead Claire Laurence has set an 11-week target for this release, aiming for final on June 18th in order to avoid clashing with Kubecon Shanghai and the July 4th holiday.

The 1.14.1 patch release came out Monday with an assortment of bug fixes for the new version.  Update your servers.

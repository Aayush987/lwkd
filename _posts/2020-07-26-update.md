## Developer News

Kubernetes 1.19 will be built [with Go 1.15](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/uN-hX5zUMFA), currently in release candidates.  This will resolve some chronic stability issues we've encountered with Go 1.14.

The move of official Kubernetes container images from  gcr.io/google-containers to gcr.io/k8s-artifacts-prod is complete; please make sure that any build services you're part of are updated.

Code of Conduct Committee [nominations are open](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/AUHqIC3B0jQ).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Cherry Pick Deadline and Test Freeze Aug. 6**

We are still in [extended code freeze](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/4V5-ORCwoUM) due to ongoing [stability issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apriority%2Fcritical-urgent) with 1.19.  Fix those failing tests, folks!

[1.19rc2 has been released](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.19.md/#v1190-rc2), with container images at the new location.  RC3 should come out tommorrow, built on Go 1.15rc1 so that you can test that out.

## Merges

* Add a [DisableAcceleratorUsageMetrics feature gate](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91930), as a warmup for the day when the kubelet doesn't collect metrics from GPUs directly
* `pod_preemption_metrics` [loses its `pod_`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93256)
* Make the TopologyManager [pay attention to reusable CPUs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93189)
* Speed up [the VolumeRestriction plugin](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93371)
* [Set cgroup max cpu.shares](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93248) to system max, in order to run on machines with 512 cores
* [Don't panic](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93225) on off-by-one container index

## Reversions

* [Backed out](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93263) Windows GPU support due to [kubelets not starting](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/93262)

## Version Updates

* [Golang to v1.15rc1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93264) in v1.19rc3
* [HNS to 9.3.-9.max/10.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93080) for Windows loadbalancing

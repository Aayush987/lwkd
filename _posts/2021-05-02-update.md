## Developer News

It's Kubecon!  And in addition to the regular sessions and keynotes and plethora of sponsored videos, we actually have [some maintainer sessions](https://kccnceu2021.sched.com/overview/type/Maintainer+Track+Sessions) where serious work is being done. Here's some particular sessions for Kubernetes contributors:

Consider Kubecon a great time to learn about SIGs other than your own! (sorry if we missed any)

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, May 13**

Get your Enhancement plans registered during the week after Kubecon.  Also, [1.22 Alpha 1 is out](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md), which mostly means the stuff that was held back during Code Freeze. Note that this already involves [one incompatible change](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95387).

Kubecon or not, your cherry-picks for the next Patch Releases are due Friday.  That release, which will include the last patch for 1.18, will come out next week.

## Featured PRs

### [ingress-nginx#8456: Implement object deep inspector](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/8456)

Ingress-nginx released v1.2.0 this week, fixing two security issues: [CVE-2021-25745](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/8502) and [CVE-2021-25746](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/8503). Both are variants on using a malicious Ingress object to exfiltrate sensitive data from inside the Ingress Controller Pod, such as the Service Account credentials. This PR introduces both a fix for the two specific issues as well as a general framework for improved object validation within ingress-nginx. If upgrading isn't an option, you can also use the [`annotation-value-word-blocklist` configuration option](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/configmap/#annotation-value-word-blocklist) to block the malicious Ingresses. If you permit low-privilege users to create arbitrary Ingresses, you should patch or mitigate these vulnerabilities as soon as possible.

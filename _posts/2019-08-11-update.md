## Developer News

The CNCF published the results of the [Kubernetes Security Audit](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2019/08/06/open-sourcing-the-kubernetes-security-audit/), which already triggered one update release, and will probably trigger more in the future.

## Meeting Summary

Last week's [Steering Committee meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qazwMIHGeF3iUh5xMJIJ6PDr-S3bNkT8tNLRkSiOkOU/edit#) discussed the [upcoming SC elections](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/3991) and the prep they still need. CoC committee election/selections are also upcoming, and rules for them are [being worked out](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/3912).  They also talked about travel support for Kubernetes contributors, and concluded that it would still be ad-hoc for San Diego but we'd like to have a program in place for 2020.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: August 15th Cherry-pick deadline for next update release, August 13th 1.16 beta0**

1.16.0-beta.0 and the 1.16 branch are going to be cut on August 13th, provided that certain [failing test jobs](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking) are resolved.

Update releases 1.15.3, 1.14.6, 1.13.10 are scheduled for Aug. 19th, which means that you need to cherry-pick in any changes by this Friday.

## Featured PRs

### [81029: Drop cloud-controller-manager artifacts from k/k release](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81029)

The project is [no longer releasing a default cloud-controller-manager](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81029). This default implementation was never used by any actual cloud provider(they bring their own), and so we're not building the images anymore, [or including it in HyperKube](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81219).

## Other Merges

* All [static pods will be considered critical](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80491) by the Kubelet, so watch out for overallocating resources
* Fix crash bugs for [AArch64 kubelet](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/79671), letting v1.16.0 support ARM64
* Cut down on APIserver requests by [not requesting a copy of the node lease every time we update it](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81174)
* The Etcd image distributed by Kubernetes [is world-executable](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/79722) to allow running it as non-root

* Fix [CSI inline migration volumes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80945) to allow downgrading
* CRD [scale subresources](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80699) are patchable, and multi-version CRDs [can have admission webhooks](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/79495)
* Stop [skipping 1.14 conformance tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80598)
* Add a [kube-proxy startup wait](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/77167) to avoid a [race condition on cluster-up](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/37414)

## Deprecated

It seems to be Deprecation Week in Kubernetesland, so read the below for more stuff you're gonna have to check your code for.

* '--basic-auth-file' is [deprecated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81152) and will be replaced with some kind of [constant-time crypto auth](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/81126) soon.

## Developer News

Just a few hours left to vote in then [Steering Committee election](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/elections/2020), so do it now.

kubernetes-incubator is [finally gone](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/72bexhYChDI).  RIP, incubator.  You were there when we needed you.

Jorge Castro [reminded folks about some housekeeping](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/DG6VGaEtirA) for mailing lists.  Rodrigo Campos wants to [collect all sidecar container use-cases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Drw9C_Ljpcr4X9UPLvms1fn8uMRnTfJLb-xipgX4C1M/edit#heading=h.eo3yz0vw744k), so add yours.  Hacktoberfest caused some [spamming of our projects](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/jDp34QS38iw), but Digital Ocean [has fixed that now](https://github.com/digitalocean/hacktoberfest/pull/596).  This does mean that you need to opt-in if you want to participate.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, Oct. 6**

Your Enhancement specs for 1.20 are [due Tuesday](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/1KF6mmO1WsQ).  While there is an [exception process](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md), it helps everyone if you can get them in on time.

Fixes for the next [patch releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/patch-releases.md) need to be cherry-picked and merged by October 9.

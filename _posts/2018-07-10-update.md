Hi there and welcome to a special guest-editor edition of LWKD. Our usual
editor is currently fighting back the fearsome code-freeze demons so I'll be
giving you a quick rundown of some of the changes from the last week (or so).

## Release Schedule

*Next Milestone: June 11th, documentation complete*

This week saw the arrival of code-freeze for 1.11 on June 5th, with many teams
working tirelessly to get things out before it, and as well see, lots of great
documentation updates in preparation for next week's doc completion target. We
should also hopefully see a 1.11.0-beta.2 release later today.

## Feature Work

### [427: Enable CoreDNS as a DNS plugin for Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/427)

As we prepare for CoreDNS being the default DNS providers in 1.11, a lot of
documentation is getting tweaked and updated. https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm/issues/843
is tracking the state of all the different updates.

### [284: Add support for resizing PVs](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/284)

Similarly we've got [documentation for online volume resizing](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/8896)
as that moves into beta.

### [127: Support node-level user namespace remapping](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/127)

There was a great push in the last few days to get node-level user namespacing
in but it looks like it will just miss the freeze deadline. Still, the [Pull Request](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64005)
is looking much better for the effort and will hopefully land once the dust settles.

### [265: Implement IPVS-based in-cluster service load balancing](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/265)

Another great push from the community that looks like it will get in just in time
is graduating IPVS load balancing up to Stable. A big round of congratulations to
everyone that helped get this feature out!

### [34: Add sysctl support](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/34)

Similarly sysctl management is planned to move up to Beta, with a nice [documentation update](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/8804)
in progress as part of that.

### [544: Custom Resource Definition Versioning](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/544)

The implementation for [CRD versioning](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63830)
was merged, and [the documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/8834)
is following closely behind.

### [548: Schedule DaemonSet Pods by kube-scheduler](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/548)

Some further refinements of [the documentation for ScheduleDaemonSetPods](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/8842)
is up pending further review.

### [554: Dynamic Maximum volume count](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/554)

Dynamic volume limits support for EC2 EBS and GCE PD volumes [was merged](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64154).

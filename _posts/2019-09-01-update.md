## Developer News

Steering Committee elections are coming up!  First, contributors should make sure they are [listed as a voter](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/events/elections/2019/voters.md).  If you want to [nominate yourself or others](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/elections/2019#candidacy-process), you need to do so by Sept. 11th.

Because of security holes, Kubernetes developers are currently [discussing removing the `kubectl cp` command](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-sig-release/3oGPk-2ElQA/discussion).  This  resulted in [one fix](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82143) and is likely to become a KEP soon; in the meantime it provides an illustration of how we decide on security vs. functionality.

If you identify as part of an under-represented minority contributor, you can request [priority access registration](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmPgGt8Mhf8TxVs1TyrBCheAypcrvfe3nFmBLowi1lXNhAlw/viewform) for the Contributor Summit in San Diego.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Draft Docs Sept. 3; final, complete docs Sept. 9th**

We are currently in Code Freeze until Sept. 10th, or however long it takes to get a clear CI signal (so fix those [test failures](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/c18TSQI5MOE) as fast as you can).

## Featured PRs

### [#77807: Add startupProbe to health checks](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/77807)

This PR implements the [slow startup KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/20190221-livenessprobe-holdoff.md), adding a new health check probe specifically for just the startup phase of containers. This is intended to allow for setting a different liveness probe timeout (or totally different check) to be used only during startup. If you have a container that takes a lot of time to initialize, this can help improve stability.

### [#77354: Use CRD validation field in server-side apply](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/77354)

Server-side apply moves the logic about merging the desired and current states of an object from `kubectl` to `apiserver`. Part of this has been an effort to improve that merge behavior when there is more than one applier that wants to own certain fields in an object. This PR improves the merge logic by using the new structural schema validation data to tell when a field should have special keyed-array-like behavior or other similar common cases in our APIs.

### [#81048: EndpointSlice Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81048)

The next phase of implementing the new endpoint management API, EndpointSlices now has a controller. The overall idea of EndpointSlices is to split up large Endpoint objects (i.e. those with a ton of Target pods) into multiple Endpoints referenced from an EndpointSlice. This two-layer API substantially multiplies the maximum number of targets for a single service without blowing up Etcd performance. Along with a controller, we also got [API discovery](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80766), [kubectl support](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81795), and support for reading from the new API [in kube-proxy](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81430). The new system is still an experiment, but it looks promising for operating at [ludicrous scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAWL8ejf2nM). If you have any code that reads from endpoints, for example an Ingress controller, you might want to start working out the changes you'll have to make for the new API.

## IPv6 Fixes

With a bunch of IPv6 code going into 1.16, Code Freeze prompted a blast of PRs:

* [Phase 2 implementation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/79386) of dual stack
* Dual stack services [added to IPVS proxier](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82091)
* Dual stack [loadbalancing on Azure](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80485)
* Make [IPVS work with iptables rules](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82214) for both IPv4 and IPv6
* Kubeadm [fixes IPv6-compliant HTTPProxy check](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82267)

## Metrics

* Let's move all the metrics onto the Metrics Stability Framework: [kube-proxy](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81626), [controller-manager](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81624), [scheduler](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81576), [kubelet](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81534), [kube-apiserver](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81531)
* Standardize some [older kubelet metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81573)
* Add [failure & error count metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81509) for auth
* Overhaul [how webhook rejections get logged and counted](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81399)

## Kubectl

* `kubectl cp` [won't copy symbolic links](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82143) due to exploits and issues
* `kubectl get --ignore-not-found` [continues after error](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82120)
* kubectl [shows PodOverhead info](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81929) in node display
* `kubectl wait` [honors `--all-namespaces`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81509)

## Other Merges

* Discovery requests [have a timeout](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82146), defaulting to 5s; use `EnableAggregatedDiscoveryTimeout=false` to disable
* Webhook client auth [needs to specify and match any non-default ports](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82252)
* Apparently we need [an `UnschedulableAndUnresolvable` status code](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82034) for the Scheduler Framework, otherwise known as the "workload DOA" code
* Start [enforcing nbf (not-before)](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81413) in ID tokens
* kubelet PluginWatcher [works on Windows](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81397), as do [vSphere volumes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80911)
* Windows [RunAsUserName gets testing](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/79539)
* Add [some new exclude endpoints](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80238) to keep users from abusing node-role labels
* ServiceAccount tokens [have JWTs too](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/78502)
* Extend [RequestedToCapacityRatio function](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/77688) to help users bin-pack their servers
* Give users visibility into why [that namespace can't be deleted](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73405)
* The APIServer [uses only http/1.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82090) to communicate with webhooks because of issues with http/2, and [has no-caching headers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81946)
* kube-apiserver gets [`/livez` endpoint](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81969) to compliment existing `readyz` endpoint; next, `jayz` endpoint

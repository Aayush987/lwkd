## Developer News

We wish our Ukranian community members, as well as contributors throughout Eastern Europe, safety for both themselves and their families, and peace soon.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Exceptions due, March 21st**

Folks are still head-down on features, although quite a few features have been [postponed from 1.24](https://bit.ly/k8s124-enhancements).  If that includes one of your favorite features, time to get more involved with it.  

[CI Signal](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/68) is steady, with the usual flakes and some test failures due to moving repositories.  Which means ... now is an excellent time for you to expand test coverage, or diagnose some of those [chronic flakes in master-informing](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-informing).

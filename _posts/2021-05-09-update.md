## Developer News

[CVE-2020-8562](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/101493) could allow users to eavesdrop on control plane communications.  However, to exploit this a user has to be authenticated and needs the permissions to create or edit Node and/or StorageClass objects, so this security issue is rated Low risk.  It is not yet patched.

Gaby Moreno Cesar has [stepped up as Chair](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/XsLE87VlAuI) of SIG-Usability. Deep Debroy has [retired from SIG-Windows](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/BuRQjrpumww) and Claudio Belu has been nominated to replace him. 

The CNCF has renamed its teams "TAGs" (or Technical Advisory Group) instead of "SIGs" which should cure some longstanding confusion between Kubernetes and CNCF teams.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, May 13th**

The 1.22 Enhancements team [has pinged every SIG](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/eYNrrfxtPd0) looking for trackable features, so if you missed that, please get yours in order, including a GitHub issue and merged KEP with all the frills. If you haven't done one of these in a while, [KEPs have gotten longer](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/NNNN-kep-template) with more stuff, so take a look.  Currently there are [40 listed enhancements](https://bit.ly/k8s122-enhancements) from only 9 SIGs, so we're sure that some of y'all are holding back.  Get those filed!

Since the Release Cycle is underway, [CI Signal Reports](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/jBzOPaKPT88) are a thing, so look there to see if you have any flaky tests that need looking after.  Kudos to SIG-Network for getting 9 flaky test issues resolved.

Patch releases for all supported versions are due out on Wednesday.  This will include the last patch for 1.18, so it's time for 1.18 users to have an upgrade plan.

## Developer News

The Ingress-NGINX project is [pausing accepting new features](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/rxtrKvT_Q8E) and spending the next season working on stability.  While they're doing that, if you are an Ingress-NGINX user, please [fill out their survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ingressngx2022) and help decide what features to prioritize when they start up again.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline:**

We are now in [Enhancements Freeze](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/qbHV81RWvq0); file an [exception](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md) if you just missed the deadline. There are 55 tracked features for the release. Another 21 were removed because of incomplete KEPs.

The first 1.25 Alpha [is available](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md).  Built with Golang 1.18.3, it includes few of the features that will eventually be in 1.25.0.

Cherry-pick deadline for the next set of patch releases is July 8th, so if you're OOO for the American holiday, get those PRs done now.

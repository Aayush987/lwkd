SIG-CLI is [looking for feedback](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/DqurOF-cnRs) on the newly-merged `kubectl alpha events` command. SIG Scalability co-chair Matt Matejczyk [will be replaced by](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/FSxFYbTw3bc) Marcel ZiÄ™ba.  

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Freeze Nov. 16**

1.23 is about to [enter code freeze](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/eet3UIYBq6Q). This means you want your PRs merged, particularly enhancement PRs, before then.  Then you'll need to immediately (Nov. 18th) create a documentation stub PR for any docs required for your enhancement.  So, maybe try to clear your calendar next week.

Cherry-picks for November's patch release are [due Friday](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/g9GJlwQaI8U).

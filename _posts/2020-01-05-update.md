Happy New Year!

As LWKD was off for the holidays, this issue covers the last three weeks of Kubernetes activity.

## Developer News

The [2020 Contributor Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/VYRJZ5G) is open!  Please submit your feedback.

The [Weekly Community Meetings will switch to monthly](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/JU9XIx6UUWk), in order to make the meetings more content-full and less effort for the Contribex team.  This will mean that SIGs may only be doing an update in the Community Meeting twice a year; SC and Contribex are exploring having the SIG updates by email or video instead.

Lest you have fewer meetings in your schedule, though,  there will be a new monthly meeting of SIG Chairs and TLs.  This is to make sure that SIG Chairs are aware of project-wide information and changes, since email doesn't seem to be working.

Two Kubernetes git repositories are being archived, partly to shut down the obsolete and problematic kubernetes-incubator namespace:

* The [external-storage](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/RrdXRltRYBo) repo is going away, and the external-provisioner has been [moved to kube-sigs](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fkubernetes-sigs%2Fsig-storage-lib-external-provisioner&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNETyOg849xXcYokrFk0nxX45GWOCg)
* [rklet](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/A_9uAki6Rww) is just going away

## Release Schedule

The [Release Team for 1.18](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.18/release_team.md) has been selected, but the release timeline is not yet published.

## Rollbacks

The holidays seem to be a time for reverting mistakes, including:

* Rollback the [reflector changes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/83520) in 1.17.0 because [they were causing performance issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/86824)
* [Revert](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/86534) the [ipallocator changes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/83422) in 1.17 because large IPv4 were misbehaving
* Restore the Scheduling framework's [`AlwaysCheckAllPredicates` flag](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/86496), removed [3 weeks ago](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/86369)
* [Revert](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/86425) hollow nodes [using remote CRI](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85879) because it broke Kubemark tests

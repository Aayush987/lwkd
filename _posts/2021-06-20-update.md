## Developer News

SIG-Node is [hosting a bug scrub](https://hackmd.io/@sig-node-bug-scrub/S1gQnDbjO) on June 24-25.  Come help squash come kubelet bugs!

SIG-Observability is considering [dropping some klog functionality](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/dAzHAdxe6ok) in order to make JSON logs match klog ones, including writing logs to specific files, adding/removing headers, and location-based stacktrace.  Are these features you're using?  [Comment on the issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/99270)

SIG-Release has published a draft [future release schedule](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/UYBJv5cg000) for 2021 releases.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Feature Blogs due, burndown meetings start June 28th**

We have rounded the corner, and begun the stretch towards Code Freeze (July 8th).  So get that code wrapped up and start working on documentation (and feature summaries).  Also, Beta 0 comes out tommorrow, so maybe test it a little. [Master-blocking](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking) is in pretty good shape, with just three jobs flaking, but [master-informing](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-informing) is a mess with 6 failing and 9 flaking tests. Please help clean that up in prep for code freeze, and if a test is just never gonna be fixed, maybe tell SIG-Release so.

Patch releases [1.21.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.21.md), [1.20.8](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.20.md), and [1.19.12](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.19.md) are available now. SIG-Release recommends that you skip the prior set of patch releases and update directly to these; if you already installed 1.21.1/1.20.7/1.19.11, then please update your cluster(s) to the current patch level immediately to ensure stability.  1.18 users, you get [1.18.20](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md), but not only is it the last patch for 1.18, it doesn't contain some fixes for issues resolved in supported versions.  So maybe upgrade RSN.

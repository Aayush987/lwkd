## Developer News

Kubernetes is replacing the SIG quarterly reports in [the Community Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VQDIAB0OqiSjIHI8AWMvSdceWhnz56jNpZrLs6o7NJY/edit#) with [Annual Reports](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/committee-steering/governance/annual-reports.md) which will be more formal, but less frequent.  This is an acknowledgement of the real schedule, and the fact that we have 37 SIGs/WGs/UGs now.

[CVE-2020-8558](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-8558) affects kube-proxy 1.18.3 and below, allowing users to [reach localhost services across the local network](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/PeIDRVc7ILE).  Please update your servers to the latest patch release to avoid it.

Third Time's The Charm: we will be once again trying to move the official image repo from `google-containers` to `k8s-artifacts-prod` starting next Monday.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Complete Docs, July 16th**

We are [now in Code Freeze](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/-HoZA0mYbw8), and v1.19 release branch is a thing.

1.18.6, 1.17.9, and 1.16.13 are expected out this Wednesday.

## Developer News

The Security committee has [published a security advisory](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/YxsVGdNlk6Q) warning folks that, if verbose logging is enabled on versions older than the latest patch versions (1.19.3, 1.18.10, 1.17.13), you may inadvertently expose application and storage secrets.  See [CVE-2020-8563](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/95621), [CVE-2020-8564](https://cert.civis.net/en/index.php?action=alert&param=CVE-2020-8564), [CVE-2020-8565](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/95623), and [CVE-2020-8566](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/95624) for more details.  And update to the latest patch version!

Also, if you are a US citizen, please take some time off from Kubernetes Nov. 3rd to vote.

## Community Meeting Summary

[TODO]

## Release Schedule

*Next Milestone: 1.12.0-alpha.1 release, July 18th*

1.12 is getting under way more formally since last week. The release notes draft is in progress, and features flying left and right. If you've got open issues in the `features` repository, make
sure to update them if you know how things are planned to shake out for this release.

A few more late-breaking bugs have held back 1.11.1, but it's still in the pipeline and will hopefully get finalized shortly.

## Feature Work

### [#65737: API linter framework and namesMatch API rule])https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/65737)

Kube-openapi has added an API definition linter (static analysis) system and this is now being enforced on all APIs. So far there is only one rule enabled:

> Go field names must be CamelCase. JSON field names must be camelCase. Other than capitalization of the initial letter, the two should almost always match. No underscores nor dashes in either.

If you have ideas for future linter rules, please contact the api-machinery SIG.

### [#65745: Enable adaptive scoring in ImageLocalityPriority](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/65745)


An improvement to the node scoring system for pod scheduling, the new, adaptive algorithm takes into account both the size of the images already available on each node (like the old algorithm) and also how common the image is on the available nodes. This will hopefully help improve performance during cold boot situations where a large number of pods can be scheduled in the same place due to image locality.

### [#65787: kubeadm: Use separate YAML docs for the kubelet and kube-proxy ComponentConfigs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/65787)


As part of the push towards v1beta for kubeadm's configuration data, the kubelet and kube-proxy configuration data are now split into two files, though the alpha2 style of including both in the same file is still supported.

### [#66039: Disable initializers by default](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/66039)

The admission controller for Initializers has been removed from the list of default controllers. This matches the fact that the Initializer API itself is disabled by default as an alpha feature. It can be re-enabled via normal admission controller configuration.

### [#66140: Allow modifying current context with kubectl set-context](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/66140)

`kubectl config set-context` can now set attributes of the current context, like the current namespace, by passing `--current` instead of a specific context name. The allows quickly updating the parameters of the current context like switching namespaces.

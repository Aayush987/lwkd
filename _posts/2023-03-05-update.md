## Developer News

Reminder: [k8s.gcr.io will be frozen](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/02/06/k8s-gcr-io-freeze-announcement/) on April 3rd.  You need to update all components to target registry.k8s.io.  Also, update your production clusters to pull from registry.k8s.io; this should work with both (updated) containerd and CRI-O now. 

The Contributor Summit [is looking for session suggestions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSei6q-WqSx0JVUbgFoGRfMvldhCa5ZaND4wRjs6inNEigbLsQ/viewform).  These can be sessions you'll lead, or sessions you want to attend -- please suggest!

Kubernetes has been invited to participate in the 2023 OpenInfra PTG. If you're interested -- especially if you were going anyway -- please [tell Kendall Nelson](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/7169).  We particularly want folks who work on the OpenStack Cloud Provider.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Feature Blog Freeze March 8th**

By the time you read this, enhancement exceptions are closed, which means its on to deciding what we'll feature in the blog. Time to do a write-up!  Code Freeze and draft docs deadline are a week from now.  [1.27 Alpha 3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md) is out if you wanted to give it a spin.

The cherry-pick deadline for the next set of patch releases is this Friday.

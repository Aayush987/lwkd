## Developer News

The changes to the [auto-close workflow](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/GjAn5qLwA64) have been merged.

The commit bot will stop suggesting `/assign` commands as part of its response to
opening a new PR, [to encourage authors to seek reviewers](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/26s2BpvHs1s)
and not go straight to approvers.  Leads and owners should boost this by recruiting/mentoring
reviewers.

Do we need to support 32-bit ARM? [Speak up](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/115738).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancement Exceptions Due, March 6**

We are now in [Enhancements Freeze](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/jWN4yi2756k)
and folks are working on the code, docs, and tests for their actual features 
in prep for Code Freeze on March 14.

New patch releases are due out this Wednesday, full of backported bug fixes.

## Developer News

Kubernetes new [Data Protection WG](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-data-protection) has been approved, and has started work.  Join [their list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-data-protection).

As part of migrating to a community-controlled, all-open source testing platform, and let the GCE staff get on with their lives, the testgrid summaries [are being generated by new code](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/DbV4MpQ3TZg).  If the summaries look wonky, try the old ones by appending `?summary=old` to your testgrid URLs, and report and difference to SIG-Testing.  

The [testing_frameworks](https://github.com/kubernetes-retired/testing_frameworks) repo [has been retired](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/1519).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, Jan 28th**

A failure of version-tagging with the anago build tool last week caused the project not to release 1.16.5 or 1.15.8 on time.  As such, the Release Engineering team will be re-releasing the patch updates on the 21st, which will include 1.17.2.  In related news they are [deprecating use of anago](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/Mhpx-loSBns) and prioritizing work on a replacement written in go (instead of bash).

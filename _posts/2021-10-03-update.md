## Developer News

The Kubernetes Steering Committee election is in the Nominations phase.  As of Oct. 4, the following candidates have been nominated and confirmed: Stephen Augustus, David Eads, Paris Pittman, Lachlan Evenson, Christoph Blecker, Ian Coldwater, Jeremy Rickard, Saiyam Pathak, and Antonio Ojea. Nominations end Oct. 14th, and voting begins Oct. 18th.  Now is also a good time to [request an exception]() if you're not marked eligible to vote.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Last Call for Exceptions, Nov 1**

Folks are hard at work on their features.  Expect little release news until after Kubecon.

Next update cherry-picks due Oct. 15.

* All klog flags other than `-v` and `-vmodule` [are now deprecated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105042), because the klog flags are a bit of [messy Kubernetes history](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/2845-deprecate-klog-specific-flags-in-k8s-components/README.md#motivation) and very hard to maintain
* v1beta1 API for scheduler component config [is removed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104782); use the v1beta3 API now

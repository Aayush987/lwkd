## Developer News

Two new security holes last week: [CVE-2022-3162](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/113756) lets custom resources in the same API group eavesdrop on each other; [CVE-2022-3294](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/113757) allows users to proxy via the apiserver to addresses they shouldn't.  Both issues are fixed in the most recent patch releases.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Test Freeze / Docs Ready for Review / Release Blog Ready, November 15**

We are in Code Freeze now, with the countdown of deadlines to final release on December 6.  This week is the trifeca of: have your feature docs ready for review, get the release blog ready for review, and freeze all test work until the final release (except bugfixes).  

Patch releases for [1.25.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md), [1.24.8](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md), [1.23.14](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md), and [1.22.16](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md) came out last week, including fixes for both of the CVEs.  This will be the *last* patch release for 1.22, so upgrade your cluster now.

Note that the next set of [patch releases](https://kubernetes.io/releases/patch-releases/) have been rescheduled to December 7, with cherry-picks due on the 2nd. SIG-Release has proposed that we [stop making release candidates of patch releases](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/wERqKRJYO9c) given the effort and image cost, so comment there if you're gonna.

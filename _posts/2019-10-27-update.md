## Developer News

Don't forgt to [register for the San Diego Contributor Summit](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubernetes-contributor-summit-north-america-2019/register/).

The Kubernetes Community Meeting is changing formats and moving to a biweekly cadence in 2020.

The brand-new [SIG-Usability](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-usability) has started having meetings and [making plans](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10BeDObYa2haF3d5k_BxXzzZcpI7ytkaLqCDZJPFkJ-c/edit#slide=id.g338ac0a8b6_0_48).  One thing they're tackling for 1.17/1.18 is secure-by-default configuration.  If you're interested in usability and user experience, maybe join them.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.17.beta0 released Oct 29th and branch**

We are almost in burndown, with Code Freeze coming November 14th.  We're branching, and testgrid will be dropping 1.13 and adding 1.17 jobs.  And all enhancements have been merged, so if you have a new one ... submit it for 1.18.

No patch releases planned this week.

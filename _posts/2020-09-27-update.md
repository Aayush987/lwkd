## Developer News

The Issue/PR triage workflow is [changing in several ways](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/YcaJpsjjLKw) on Sep. 30th.  If you triage contributions to your SIG you'll need to know the new commands.  The new triage is to help make fewer issues "fall between the cracks."

The [Reliability WG](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/5170) is in the process of approval; this new working group plans to create ways of measuring reliability and detecting reliability breakage in order to stop breaking changes from getting into releases.

The [Steering Committee election](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/elections/2020) is still open for voting; please vote using the ballot you received or [file a request for a replacement](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/kubernetes-sc-2020-ballot).

Evan Anderson submitted [new Condition Guidance](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/4521) for custom controllers.  After months of discussion, this document details some conventions for the project, to hopefully lead to controllers having the same general workflows and status information.

Rodrigo is [planning a live meeting](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/ymqA_rozYEE) to discuss the [in-progress KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1980) for improving sidecar containers.  

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, October 6th**

You have one week to file/update your enhancements to get them into 1.20.  A lot of folks working on features for the 1.19 cycle that didn't make it in haven't spoken up yet, so this is your wake-up call.

In this 3rd week of the 1.20 cycle, the team has determined some dates, including Test Freeze on Nov. 23rd, and final release planned for December 8.  More importantly, the 1.20 milestone restriction has been lifted, so you can do your normal early-release-cycle development.

The next set of patch releases is planned for Oct. 14, with a cherry-pick deadline of Oct. 9.

## Developer News

The Issue/PR triage workflow is [changing in several ways](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/YcaJpsjjLKw) on Sep. 30th.  If you triage contributions to your SIG you'll need to know the new commands.  The new triage is to help make fewer issues "fall between the cracks."

The [Reliability WG](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/5170) is in the process of approval; this new working group plans to create ways of measuring reliability and detecting reliability breakage in order to stop breaking changes from getting into releases.

The [Steering Committee election](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/elections/2020) is still open for voting; please vote using the ballot you received or [file a request for a replacement](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/kubernetes-sc-2020-ballot).

Evan Anderson submitted [new Condition Guidance](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/4521) for custom controllers.  After months of discussion, this document details some conventions for the project, to hopefully lead to controllers having the same general workflows and status information.

Rodrigo is [planning a live meeting](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/ymqA_rozYEE) to discuss the [in-progress KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1980) for improving sidecar containers.

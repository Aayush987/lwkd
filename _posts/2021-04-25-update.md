## Developer News

We had our first [community meeting](http://bit.ly/k8scommunity) in the new format last week, led by Laura Santamaria.  SIG-Release discussed the 3-releases KEP, and SIG-CLI explained the overhaul for the coming kubectl exit codes.  Future community meetings will also focus on topics of interest to our whole contributor community, so join us next month!

The Production Readiness WG [would like you to take a survey](https://forms.gle/scyYXWcXdRAZkmCc8).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Tracking starts today**

The 1.22 release [has a schedule now](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.22), and Enhancements lead James Laverack [has started collecting your enhancments](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/n2_XTbZZXuw); please note per his message that there is a new (as of 2021) system for tracking them.  As part of the new 3/year release schedule, 1.22 will be 15 weeks. Important dates:

* May 13th: Enhancements Freeze
* July 8th: Code Freeze
* August 4th: Release

Our next set of [patch releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/patch-releases.md) closes to cherry-picks on May 7th and is expected out May 12th.  Importantly, 1.18 has been [extended with one more patch](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/pull/1532), so the last 1.18 will be 1.18.19, which not incidentally includes a [security fix](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101335).  After this month, though, you'd better start working on upgrading to a supported version.

## Other Merges

* The `pods/ephemeralcontainers` API now [expects you to pass a pod](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101034) instead of an ephemeralcontainers object; this is a breaking API change
* `kubectl describe` now has a [`--chunk-size` parameter](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101171) to keep large resource lists from overwhelming the client; this does mean that all object code will need to support chunking

## Developer News

Kubernetes switched over to using EasyCLA for CLA verification on Feb 5. You can tell Prow `/easlycla` to recheck your CLA status.  If that doesn't work, [file an LF ticket](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/servicedesk/customer/portal/4) and [add your report to the tracking issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/3068).

Since klog flags were [deprecated in 1.23](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-logs/#klog), folks who import klogs into their go code may need to [re-import `http://k8s.io/component-base/logs`](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/_mRNTYDb7ys) and do some troubleshooting.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Exceptions due, March 21st**

We are now in Enhancements Freeze, which means if your KEP/feature isn't already on the [tracking sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T21mUTvPh70NB2eseHjCyD4LgRjyxWI9Bd1SoP8zAwA/edit#gid=936265414) you'll need to file an Exception (before Mar 21).  

CI Signal is looking OK, but there's a [bunch of flaky test jobs](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/wG0EQt_QxCk), particularly in [master-informing](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-informing), which is almost 50% flaky. If you own any of those jobs, please have a look.

Cherry pick deadline for this month's [patch releases](https://kubernetes.io/releases/patch-releases/) is this Friday.

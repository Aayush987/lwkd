## Developer News

The Kubernetes 1.19 release schedule has changed, see below.

The [kubernetes-anywhere project](https://github.com/kubernetes-retired/kubernetes-anywhere), a deprecated predecessor to kubeadm, has been archived.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze May 19th**

Due to the effect of COVID-19 on many people's schedules, the [release of v1.19](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.19) is [officially postponed to August 4th](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/pull/1065) in order to give all contributors a more relaxed release schedule.  Code Freeze starts June 25th to give extra time for stabilizing.  Patch support for v1.16 will be extended until September, implementing [the Year Support KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1497) by default.

This means that only 3 versions of Kubernetes will be released this year.  The project is undecided as to whether that might be a permanent change.

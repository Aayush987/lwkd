## Community Meeting Summary


## Release Schedule


## Featured PRs

### [#80037: Remove support for etcd2 from cluster/images/etcd image](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80037)

Etcd2 support is long since removed, and so now the official Etcd images will no longer include the 2->3 migration tools. If you still need these tools, you can use an older version of the image or run them some other way. This is unlikely to catch most dev clusters but if you still have Etcd2 in a dark corner somewhere, no time like the present to upgrade it.

### [#79549: Promote admission webhook API to v1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/79549)

Admission webhooks have graduated to v1! And with this comes a bunch of changes from beta to GA, mostly changes to the default values of fields to encourage safer usage of webhooks. To shamelessly quote from the release notes:

* `failurePolicy` default changed from `Ignore` to `Fail` for v1.
* `matchPolicy` default changed from `Exact` to `Equivalent` for v1.
* `timeout` default changed from `30s` to `10s` for v1.
* `sideEffects` default value is removed and the field made required for v1.
* `admissionReviewVersions` default value is removed and the field made required for v1 (supported versions for AdmissionReview are `v1` and `v1beta1`).
* The `name` field for specified webhooks must be unique for `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` and `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` objects created via `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1`.

The v1beta1 versions will still be available until 1.19 as per normal deprecation cycles.

### [#78447: Migrate scheduler to use v1beta1 Event API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/78447)

A small change but should be a nice performance improvement for the scheduler, using the new Event API. This should be a transparent change, unless you have custom integrations with the scheduler subsystem.

### [community#3663: Add Code of Conduct Committee Charter](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/3663)

And finally our awesome code of conduct team has finalized their official group charter. This formalizes the mission and scope of the committee as well as detailing how it operates. I would strongly encourage all community members to give it a quick read so they are familiarized with this team.

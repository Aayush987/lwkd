## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.25 Released, August 23rd**

[Kubernetes 1.25 is released](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/08/23/kubernetes-v1-25-release/)!  PodSecurity replaces PodSecurityPolicy, and many features graduate to stable: Ephemeral Volumes, cGroups v2, CSI Migration, scheduler ComponentConfig, Network PortRange, and more.

[1.24.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md), [1.23.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md), and [1.22.13](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md) came out last week.  This update fixes [JobTrackingWithFinalizers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111664) and a bunch of memory leaks, and [updates Golang](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111639).

## Developer News

CJ Cullen reported [CVE-2019-11254](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/_50wAC9pXQ8) a denial-of-service vulnerability in Kubernetes.  Maliciously crafted YAML can cause the Kube-APIserver to lock up.  Upgrade to the latest patch release of 1.15-1.17 to fix this -- but maybe make sure that only authorized users can send API requests, regardless?

Kevin Weismueller has [proposed creating an API Expression Working Group](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/4655), with the goal of [codifying the structure of our API objects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XYbQXfge2qKM9psksfC5XZnW8hybtLqL1EcJLU4JwKg/edit).  In the meantime, WG Resource Management [is shutting down](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/3OyFrkQfRTA).

Kubernetes is [no longer permitting merges](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/17037) of PRs that themselves contain merge commits on the main repos. We've also added a [`kind/regression` label](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/17055) to all Kubernetes namespace repos, in order to distiguish regression issues from other kinds of bugs.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release schedule published, this week**

Patch Releases: v1.17.3, v1.16.7, and v1.15.10 were released last week to patch a security hole.  Since that's now public, update as soon as you can.

## Community Meeting Summary


## Release Schedule


## Featured PRs

### [#66391: Support dry run in admission plugins](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/66391)

If DryRun requests are enabled, they will now go through the usual admission
controller chain. This ensures that dry-run results are closer to reality but
could catch some controllers unawares if they have external side effects and don't
check the request type. There was also a small follow-up PR [to disable webhook
controllers during dry-run](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67085).

### [#67178: Vendor cfssl/cfssljson utilities](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67178)

We've had a few issues with mismatched versions of the `cfssl` utilities in the
past so to ensure everyone stays on the same cycle, we've vendored them. This
should be entirely transparent unless you've made local modifications to one of
the tools.

### [#66512: Skip building openapi for ignored paths](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/66512)

A potential small speed up for local development, if ignoring some paths you
don't have to generate the OpenAPI for then.

### [#67010: Create LICENSE for logo](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67010)

A (very) short PR but a good reminder to always attribute the Kubernetes logo
when using it in other projects or presentations.

### [#65147: Document /watch prefix deprecation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/65147)

While the `/watch` API has been deprecated for a while now, we've never updated
the documentation to reflect this fact. A good prompt to double check any
third-party client libraries or scripts to ensure you've switched over to `?watch=true`.

## Developer News

As of 1.20 (out this week), Dockershim will be deprecated in core Kubernetes.
Learn what this means for you in the [blog](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dont-panic-kubernetes-and-docker/) and [FAQ](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dockershim-faq/).  Mostly, if you're still
using serverside Docker on your Kubernetes clusters, it's maybe time to think
about gradually migrating to Containerd and/or CRI-O as your container runtime
instead.

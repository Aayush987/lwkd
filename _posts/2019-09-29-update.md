## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.17 Enhancements Freeze, October 15th**

1.17 has started and [is a short release](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.17), so expect some close deadlines.  Release Team shadows are being selected this week.  Other important deadlines: Code Freeze Nov. 14th, Docs due Nov 19th, and planned final release December 9th.

**Patch Releases**: 1.16.1 is due out October 2nd.  The [following patch releases](https://git.k8s.io/sig-release/releases/patch-releases.md) have a cherry-pick deadline of Oct. 11th and expected release date of Oct 15th:  1.16.2, 1.15.5, 1.14.8 and 1.13.12.  Note that 1.13.12 will be the *last* community update to 1.13; if you are running that version in production, please upgrade to a more recent Kubernetes release now.

## Featured PRs

As another relatively quiet week, we are going to highlight some easily overlooked but important PRs.

### [#81030: migrate leader election to lease API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81030)

This was first attempted [back in June](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80508) but ended up blocked on some critical issues so I'm super glad to see it come back. The leader election API in client-go is used not just by core components like the scheduler and controller manager, but by many custom controllers and operators in the community. Moving things to the leases API helps not just reduce load on Etcd, but also keep RBAC permissions for controllers a little clearer. Migration paths for both endpoint-based and configmap-based elections are included, allowing you to keep both systems in sync during an upgrade.

### [#83014: Bump k8s.io/klog to v1.0.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/83014)

Our little baby klog is all grown up! Moving to 1.0 shows that the API changes in klog are now happily stabilized and should be a smoother all around developer experience going forward. Big congrats to everyone that has helped out with the klog migration over the past year.

### [community#4129: Update SIG diagram](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/4129)

And finally an old-fashioned image of the week:

![Kubernetes SIG diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/community/46b4da958094b4158ab5188acecea3630419b9bc/SIG-diagram.png)

This community documentation refresh is a great overview of what SIGs exist and their relationships to each other and their WGs.

* You can measure [`authentication_latency_seconds`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82409)
* kube-dns [runs with fewer privileges](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82347), such as requiring non-root at runtime

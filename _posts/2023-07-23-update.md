## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Test Freeze and Docs Due, July 25**

We are now in Code Freeze, with 41 tracked Enhancements, and [on target for an August 15 release](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/sfWsGw_RcQE).  Tuesday is the big day for all the code freeze activities, with a halt to test changes (except bug fixes), documentation ready for review, RC0 released, and the 1.28 release branched.  Comms and the SIG Leads will also decide the [major themes of the 1.28 release](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/discussions/2271), and release notes will start working on their draft.  Mickey Boxell, Release Lead Shadow, says that even though we're past the deadline for Feature Blog items, if you have something really good, opt-in and contact the release team.

Patch releases [1.27.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md), [1.26.7](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.26.md), [1.25.12](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md), [1.24.16](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md) came out last week. This includes a Go version bump.  **This is the last update for 1.24**.

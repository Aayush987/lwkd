## Developer News

[Kubernetes 1.17](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.17.md/#v1170) has been released!  Interesting features include (but are not limited to) better IPv6 and DualStack support, using EndpointSlices instead of Endpoints for everything, and CSI Topology goes GA in time to [make everyone migrate to CSI using Volume Migration](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/12/09/kubernetes-1-17-feature-csi-migration-beta/).  Look out for all of the deprecated metrics that haven been removed from this version, and the requirement for Go 1.13.4+.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Kubernetes 1.18 cycle begins, January 2**

v1.17 is released, which means we now enter the limbo of the Holiday season, before work on the next release begins on the new year.  If you're interested in serving on the 1.18 release team, [follow the team issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/871).

Updates on all supported versions, including [1.14.10](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/hESFCjjeqWA), [1.15.7](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/n62_NQcSveY), and [1.16.4](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/hbNwT260eIU), are due to be released on Wednesday December 11th.  If you're still using 1.13, it's past time to upgrade.

## 1.17 Merges

* Webhook backend requests [don't get rate-limited](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85810), fixing a major performance regression

## 1.18 Merges

* Scheduler [explains all predicate failures](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/86022) instead of just the one it hated the most
* Overhauled [Kubelet Cert TTL handling](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85874), including renaming the stat `certificate_manager_server_ttl_seconds` and having it report the number of seconds until timeout; we also get [a metric for rotation errors](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/84614)
* Kubeadm now checks for [conntrack](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85857) since it's a dependency of the Kubelet, and has [refactored how it handles component configs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85639) with the side effect of erroring if you feed it an unsupported version
* `kubectl drain` [adds option `skip-wait-for-delete-timeout`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85577) to keep you from waiting for stubborn pods forever, and [`disable-eviction`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85571) so you can kill pods with extreme prejudice; drain also [supports dry-run](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82660)
* EncryptionConfiguration [finally gets some defaults and validation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85363)
* CSI PVs [show FSType](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85293) in `kubectl decribe`
* [metadata-agent containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/83363) and [metrics-server containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/83362) need to run on Linux nodes in a mixed cluster

## Deprecated

* A whole bunch of [kubelet metrics deprecated in 1.14](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/83841) are getting removed in 1.18

## Version Updates (in 1.18)

* [addon-resizer to 1.8.7](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85793)
* [go-winio to 0.4.14](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85739)

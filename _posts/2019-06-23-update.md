## Community Meeting Summary

Welcome to 1.15! The community meeting this week as the [release retrospective](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Re80f4qICEKLEhOEIFuzr0IZTp2es82urMi45PrScLM/edit#heading=h.ukbaidczvy3r). Overall the feeling was positive, with some frustration around phase deadlines getting crunched around other events, leading to some reviewer overload. There will also be more attempts to limit internally-breaking changes later in the release cycle to have few disruptions to testing.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.16 Start of Release Cycle, July 1**

We're in that always-too-brief respite between release cycles. If you're interested in helping out with 1.16 as a shadow, please [comment on the Issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/648).

And for 1.15, be sure to check out the [changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.15.md) if you haven't already.

## Featured PRs

### [#78187: Update vendored dependencies to released version](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/78187)

It's mostly a quiet week between releases but we do have a nice big dependencies upgrade. This includes switching off the unmaintained version of go-bindata, as well as lots of individual library updates to make sure we're on tagged versions.

### [#70672: Stop serving deprecated beta workload APIs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/70672)

Another small but lovely change, the old beta workload types from `apps` and `extensions` are finally gone. To quote from the release notes:

```
The following APIs are no longer served by default:
* All resources under `apps/v1beta1` and `apps/v1beta2` - use `apps/v1` instead
* `daemonsets`, `deployments`, `replicasets` resources under `extensions/v1beta1` - use `apps/v1` instead
* `networkpolicies` resources under `extensions/v1beta1` - use `networking.k8s.io/v1` instead
* `podsecuritypolicies` resources under `extensions/v1beta1` - use `policy/v1beta1` instead
```

A nice step forward in cleaning up some GVK sprawl.

### [test-infra#13104: Refactoring of Testgrid Readme Files](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/13104)

And finally a nice documentation refresh from the SIG-Testing crew. If you've been meaning to learn more about Testgrid, now is a great time to read up!

## Meeting Summary

During last Wednesday's [Steering Committee meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qazwMIHGeF3iUh5xMJIJ6PDr-S3bNkT8tNLRkSiOkOU/edit#), docs lead Zach Corliessen announced that [SIG-Docs would be removing and prohibiting most 3rd party content](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/15576) in the Kubernetes docs.  The change intends to prevent duplication of external docs, as well as proliferation of "configuring Kubernetes with Tool X" pages.

This was also the last SC meeting for the current members.  There is now a new committee thanks to the election of new members announced last Thursday:

## Developer News

SIG-Release will be [meeting 9/22](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fu6HxXQu8wl6TwloGUEOXVzZ1rwZ72IAhglnaAMCPqA/edit#heading=h.3vmhgtz3uu5u) to discuss reopening full development by removing the 1.20 milestone restriction.  If you have opinions on this, please attend.

The [Steering Committee election](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/elections/2020) is in progress, please vote.  If you didn't get your ballot, [request a replacement](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/kubernetes-sc-2020-ballot).  Also, we are [planning to replace CIVS](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5096)
 for Kubernetes elections in the future, and we [have a CommunityBridge project about it](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/09/21/calling-all-mentees-cncf-communitybridge-projects-for-the-fall-2020-program/), so encourage eligible interns to apply.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, October 6th**

With 1.20 development under way, you need to [file your planned enhancements](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/J9KWovW9XM0) with lead Kirsten Garrison.  Remember, you need a KEP and a milestone issue. There's a [full release schedule](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.20) for more info.

[1.19.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.19.md#v1192),[1.18.9](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md#v1189), and [1.17.12](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.17.md#v11712) were released last Wednesday, with a host of bugfixes, primarily to EndpointSlice functionality and Azure support.  Also v1.19 was [upgraded to Go 1.15.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94838) to incorporate golang bugfixes.

## Featured PRs

### [#91993: Do not allow manual changes to manageFields via subresources](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91993)

A possibly breaking change if you were doing something very weird in a custom controller, the status and scale subresources will no longer accept changes to `metadata.managedFields`. This will ensure that intentional manual changes must all flow through the main resource API.

### [#90969: Ignore not found in `kubectl wait --for=delete`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90969)

A simple change, now `kubectl wait --for=delete` will not exit with a failed exit code if the object doesn't exit. This is mostly aimed at simplifying cleanup scripts that call several deletes and then wait for them all to complete. Previously if a delete finished quickly, that could throw things out of whack. Now it will do the expected thing even in that race condition case.

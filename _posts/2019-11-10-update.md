## Developer News

1.17 Code Freeze is this week, see below.

Hyperkube is [being pulled out of the main kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/81760) repo, and currently has some [shims to allow it to continue to build](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/84662). Projects like kubeadm are [dropping support for it](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm/issues/1889).  So, if you make use of Hyperkube, now's the time to either rip it out of your dependency tree or volunteer to maintain it.

Do you run multiple Kubernetes clusters?  If so, SIG-MC wants to [survey you](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/5ZXRMY8).

Next week is Kubecon San Diego.  Noah and Josh will both be there, sporting our new LWKD shirts, which means we will not be writing LWKD.  If we can wedge it in, we'll add a writeup of the Contributor Summit; otherwise, no LWKD next week.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: CODE FREEZE Nov. 14th**

That's right, you have a couple days to get your 1.17 changes in shape to be shipped, or pull them.  After Thursday, you'll need cherry-pick approval to add anything to 1.17.  Also, you should already have your docs PR (as of Nov 8th).

The following patch releases are expected Nov. 13th:

* 1.14.9
* 1.15.6
* 1.16.3

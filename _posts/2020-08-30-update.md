## Developer News

[1.19 has been released!](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/08/26/kubernetes-release-1.19-accentuate-the-paw-sitive/)  With this release, the patch support window is extended to one year, you get ephemeral volumes, GA Ingress and Seccomp, and structured logging.

The [Steering Committee Election](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/elections/2020) is in progress.  You have until September 8th to nominate candidates, and to make sure that you are [represented in voters.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/events/elections/2020/voters.md) if you should be eligible to vote, and that the project has your email address.  [Ten candidates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G2x1CIK_1wtittb_Eu3OdaDRv8UvPZ_2_SR7pfpIpQE/edit#gid=0) have been nominated so far.

Give the new, all-golang, OSS, [beta Testgrid](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-misc#ci-bazel&grid=beta) a try!  Just append `grid=beta` when you look at your test results.

You can use [Asset Transparency to download](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/iWr5FiOyU78) Kubernetes binaries instead of `curl`.  And the kubeadm team wants [feedback from IoT users](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/1ce1fr_YyXo).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Cherry-pick for 1.19.1, Sept. 4**

1.19 has been released, which means that the first bugfix release isn't far behind.  Get your fixes in by this Friday.

If you want to be on the 1.20 Release Team, [apply to become a shadow](https://forms.gle/58jyAeewYGJNbsVZA)

[1.16.15](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.16.md/#v11615), the last update of 1.16, was released on Sept. 2.  If you're using 1.16, time to look at upgrading to 1.17 or 1.18.

## Featured PRs

### [#92491: compile out gofuzz from prod binaries](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92491)

This adds a new `notest` build flag to remove gofuzz and enables that for release builds. If you have test-only dependencies, consider using the same style of conditional compilation to keep our binaries smaller.

### [#91602: Lock-free broadcaster](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91602)

Performance is always a tricky thing to balance, but this PR is a great example of using more advanced techniques for a very real speedup. 10 nanoseconds per broadcast adds up fast!

### [#94272: remove deprecated kubelet endpoint /metrics/resource/v1alpha1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94272)

The metrics `v1alpha1` endpoint in the Kubelet has been deprecated since 1.18, and has now been removed. The newer `metrics/resources` endpoint should be a relatively drop-in for most uses so be sure to update your metrics systems!

## Other Merges

* Kubeadm [uses the local API endpoint](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94398), [ensures etcd manifest upgrade](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94395), and [won't unmount `/var/lib/kubelet`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93702)
* Reflector [recovers from requesting invalid resource version numbers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94316) from the API
* `kubectl get ingress` [uses the v1 Ingress instead of beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94309)
* our error messages don't follow RFC 1123, [so tell requestors](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94182)
* fix [legacy auth](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94035) for Scheduler

* use [correct verbs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93523) in apiserver metrics
* don't [create a StatefulSet](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93457) that requires a PVC pending deletion

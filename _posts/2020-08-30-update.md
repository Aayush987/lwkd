## Community Meeting Summary


## Release Schedule


## Featured PRs

### [#92491: compile out gofuzz from prod binaries](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92491)

This adds a new `notest` build flag to remove gofuzz and enables that for release builds. If you have test-only dependencies, consider using the same style of conditional compilation to keep our binaries smaller.

### [#91602: Lock-free broadcaster](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91602)

Performance is always a tricky thing to balance, but this PR is a great example of using more advanced techniques for a very real speedup. 10 nanoseconds per broadcast adds up fast!

### [#94272: remove deprecated kubelet endpoint /metrics/resource/v1alpha1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94272)

The metrics `v1alpha1` endpoint in the Kubelet has been deprecated since 1.18, and has now been removed. The newer `metrics/resources` endpoint should be a relatively drop-in for most uses so be sure to update your metrics systems!

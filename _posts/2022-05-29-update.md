## Developer News

Please make sure that your Zoom client (for community meetings) is updated to at least 5.10.0; there is [a security hole](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2254) in earlier versions.

The Release Cadence Survey is concluded and [our community seems to prefer 3 releases a year](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/1526#issuecomment-1124641335).  Also, half of y'all are using EOL versions.

There was no May Community Meeting due to KubeCon.


## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Due, June 16**

The [1.25 Release Cycle](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.25) has begun, [led by Cici Huang](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/hs1k8r6UPDo), which means [the team is collecting enhancements](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/slwAhtVqjXk) already. Make sure to [add your planned enhancement](https://bit.ly/k8s125-enhancements) to the list.

The [Test Plan Section](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/commit/a86942e8ba802d0035ec7d4a9c992f03bca7dce9) for Enhancement KEPs has been enlarged with the goal of ensuring better testing of new features.  Make sure you're ready to fill out this additional information (and plan to write tests) before finalizing your KEP.

Patch releases [1.24.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md), [1.23.7](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md), [1.22.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md), and [1.21.13](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.21.md) are now available.  As 1.21 is now over a year old, it will be EOL soon and users on that version should have plans to upgrade. Significant patches include a golang update and fixing JobTrackingWithFinalizers.

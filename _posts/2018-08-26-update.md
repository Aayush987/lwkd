## Community Meeting Summary


## Release Schedule


## Featured PRs

### [#58679: Support annotations for admission webhook](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58679)

A new `AuditAnnotations` field in the admission webhook response struct allows
setting arbitrary key/value pairs which get written to the audit log. This can
be used to record data related to the webhook call for future debugging or
analysis.

### [#66971: #50102 Task 2: Add UntilWithSync](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/66971)

A follow up to [#66906](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/66906) last
week, this adds a new `UntilWithSync` method to avoid some common bugs when
writing watches. This new kind of watch will survive timeouts, reconnects, and
other conventional client-side errors. The downside is that the guarantees are
not quite as strong as a basic `Until` call, mostly with respect to event ordering
and duplication. If you want to write a long-lived watch, consider if `UntilWithSync`
can do the job.

### [#67518: Add RuntimeHandler to the CRI RunPodSandboxRequest](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67518) and [#67737: Runtimeclass pod API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67737)

A double header, two parts of [kubernetes/features#585](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/585) got merged
this week. The first adds a handler configuration layer to the low-level CRI
interface, allowing some configuration of the underlying container runtime from
higher levels of the system. This is paired with adding a `RuntimeClassName`
field to the `PodSpec` API. It's not yet hooked up to anything, but eventually
will let pods select specific container runtimes or configurations of a single
runtime.

### [#67675: Pass files to golint one at a time](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67675)

Rather than passing large ranges of files into `golint`, it will now pass files
in one at a time. This should provide better output, as `golint` exits on the
first fatal error in any file.

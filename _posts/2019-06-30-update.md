## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.16 Release Cycle begins, July 1st**

We've started 1.16, and a [schedule](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.16) for the release is up.  Important dates:

* July 30th: Enhancements Freeze
* August 29th: Code Freeze
* Sept. 9th: Docs complete
* Sept. 16th: Release

So, time to start marking your enhancment proposals with milestone v1.16, and work on those KEPs.

## Featured Merges

### [Runtimeclass admission #78484](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/78484)

Creates a new admission controller for RuntimeClass, primarily so that we can [account for resources tied to the pod sandbox](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/688).

### [Volume Scheduling Limits #77595](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/77595)

SIG Storage has been working for a while to give you the ability to [limit how many volumes of each type](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-storage/20190408-volume-scheduling-limits.md) that can be deployed on a node.  This PR implements most of that, in a way that's the same for both CSI and in-tree providers.

## Cleanup Week

The first week of a new release cycle is often a "cleanup week" where devs take care of a whole lot of pending refactoring that has been waiting since last release, or longer.  This week is no exception:

* The alpha `metadata.initializers` field, deprecated since 1.13, [got removed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/79504)
* Remove the [feature gates for CSI](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/79309), since it's been GA
* Clean up [5 different self-set Node labels](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/79305), and [prevent Nodes from changing labels](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-auth/0000-20170814-bounding-self-labeling-kubelets.md#implementation-timeline) they shouldn't
* [Refactor `pkg/util/mount`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/68513) so that it can be included in external code, such as CSI driver repos
* Get the Conformance Test Walker [to understand nested Describes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/79405) so that it can handle complex tests correctly
* Replace the "pause" Pod with the platform-neutral [agnhost Image](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/79012) so that our whole e2e test framework will work for Conformance
* Clean up the upgrade tests so that [they don't restart all pods on APIserver upgrade](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/78914)
* Add [unit test coverage](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/78863) for APIextensions
* Refactor [how bootstrap tokens are handled](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/77211) in Kubeadm

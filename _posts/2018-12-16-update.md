## Featured PRs

### [#72096: Promote NodeLease to Beta and enable by default](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/72096)

A small patch, but a big impact for all of us! The NodeLease system will be activated by default for 1.14. This moves the node status system away from expensive timed health checks and on to a dedicated API using long-lived leases. This dramatically reduces both DB size and I/O usage for Etcd in large clusters. A very welcome improvement for the future!

### [#71885: Create /var/lib/etcd with 0700](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/71885)

Another small but useful change, this time improving the security for Etcd with better file permissions on the data directories. If you run your own Etcd, maybe double check your current file perms and tweak them if need be.

### [#71872: scheduler cleanup phase 2: Rename `pkg/scheduler/cache` to `pkg/scheduler/nodeinfo`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/71872)

And finally a more substantial PR to look over, the last remaining bits of the `scheduler/cache` package have been moved, either to `scheduler/internal/cache` or to the new node info package. Overall it looks like 1.14 will be a banner release for the scheduler, big congrats to the whole sig-scheduling team!

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.16.0 Release, September 18th**

We will release version 1.16 this Wednesday, which is a two-day delay from the original Sept. 16th deadline, in order to check CI Signal stability. Keep TestGrid Green!

Several update releases were scheduled for Sept. 18, but may be delayed due to the major release:

* 1.15.4
* 1.14.7
* 1.13.11

## Featured PRs

### [enhancements#807: kubernetes-csi release process](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/807)

The CSI team has nicely formalized a lot of the release management process. CSI has historically had a more ad-hoc release process so it's great to see things getting solidified and more bidirectional testing between k/k and CSI.

### [test-infra#14296: start run books](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/14296)

Hopefully the first of many, the SIG-Testing team now has a place for recording operational knowledge for the tooling that keeps Kubernetes flying. If you're interested in writing (or co-writing) a runbook on one of the testing tools, please reach out to SIG-Testing (though probably after Wednesday).

### [#82514: Exec probes should not be unbounded](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82514)

A relatively simple cleanup, this PR and the corresponding fix for [HTTP probes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82669) help to improve stability in strange edge cases. While a probe with never-ending output would likely not be the easiest attack vector, always be careful with user-controlled runtime data and don't assume standards compliance or reasonableness.

## Developer News

We plan to [switch to EasyCLA on February 5th](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/3sChLAt0FZc).  Please check the EasyCLA results in any PRs you submit this week; is EasyCLA correctly finding your CLA? If not, [file a ticket](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/servicedesk/customer/portal/4) as soon as you see problems.

Reminder: now that [`kubernetes-dev@googlegroups` has been replaced by `dev@kubernetes.io`](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/DB0wVQDjjPA), please remember to share any community docs you have (like SIG agendas, etc.) with `dev@kubernetes.io`.

What if logging in Kubernetes was fully pluggable? Patrick Ohly is [soliciting feedback on a KEP for "contextual logging"](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3078). Drawback: requires another project-wide overhaul, just like structured logging did.

SIG-Docs has [promoted a bunch of new people to leadership](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/SP6weMvx3wg), including adding some new lead roles such as "Localization Lead".  Frederic Branczyk has stepped down as TL of SIG-Instrumentation and [the SIG suggests Damien Grisonnet](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/EgLQ5ynIbaw) to take his place.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: PRR heads-ups due, January 27th**

This is the 2nd week of the 1.24 release cycle, and y'all should be at work on your KEPs.  The first [CI Signal report](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/71wBPA65Y9I) is out, so take a look at [those flaky/failing tests](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/68/), please!

Updates for 1.23, 1.22, 1.21, and 1.20 are due out Wednesday. This will be the last update for 1.20, so folks on that version should be planning upgrades.

## Featured PRs

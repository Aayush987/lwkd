## Developer News

Happy Independence Day, Americans!  Short issue today because of the American holiday.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Freeze, July 8th**

Code Freeze is this Thursday.  We'll also release 1.22 Beta 1 on the same day, and placeholder Doc PRs will be due Friday.  So, maybe do the easy thing and open your placeholder PRs now?

For the hard thing: here's the [CI Report](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/u1LMXHcKhbg), which is *not* looking good for Code Freeze week.  We have a [failing job](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking#gce-cos-master-alpha-features) in [Master-Blocking](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking), plus 5 flaking jobs, and 12 failing or flaking jobs in [Master-Informing](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-informing).  All of those are gonna need to get looked at in the next week, so if you can help with a test fail/flake, please do ASAP.

Cherry-picks for the next round of patch releases are due this Friday as well.

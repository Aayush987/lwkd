## Community Meeting Summary

Last week's [Community Meeting](http://bit.ly/k8scommunity) started with a demo of [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko), a tool from Google's container tools team to allow building container images inside Kubernetes (or other contained environments) without either `privileged` mode (a la `docker-in-docker` or bind-mounting the underlying control socket from the hypervisor.

This is a big step towards safer image builds from inside Kubernetes-based CI/CD systems, though make sure to read up on the security properties of Kaniko and the other image build options as there are still many "gotchas".

We also heard from the incoming 1.12 release lead, the 1.12 [release team](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.12/release_team.md) is shaping up nicely. They are still looking for a [branch manager](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release#release-branch-manager), if you're interested in helping out with either role, message `@tpepper` or the `#sig-release` channel in the [community Slack](http://slack.k8s.io/), or leave a note on the [tracking issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/167). If you're not feeling up to being a role lead, they are also looking for more shadows on CI signal and release notes.

## Release Schedule

*Next Deadline: End of code freeze, June 19th (EOD PST)*

Last week was [week 11](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.11/release-1.11.md) of the 1.11 release cycle.
The biggest milestone last week was documentation complete for 1.11, and things are looking great for an on-time end of code-freeze (19th) and branching for the RC1 release (20th). Big congratulations to Josh and the whole sig-release team for making this one of the smoothest cycles yet!

## Documentation Updates

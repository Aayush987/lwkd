## Developer News

The [April Community Meeting](http://bit.ly/k8scommunity) is this Thursday (1700UTC / 10am PDT). We plan to discuss topics around running SIGs, including [chair term limits](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5886), annual reports, and [dividing Tech Leads from Chairs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5890).  We'll probably also hash out how to handle [non-expiring critical bugs](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/25967).

Dims [issued a call for action](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/n6Zf-wspYHU) on our panoply of flaky test jobs and tests. Please see what you can do to make our tests more reliable, and see SIG-Testing for guidance on how to get started.

All Kubernetes developers should [update their dev environments to go 1.18.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109484)

[Registration](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/kcseu/registration/) for the [Kubecon EU Contributor Summit](https://k8s.dev/summit), including a social event, is open.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release Candidate and Branch, April 19th**

We are officially in overtime for 1.24, which has been delayed until May 3rd due to waiting for Go 1.18.1. Please use this time to [clean up flaky and failing tests](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/68/), including a [failing test in master-blocking](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking#skew-cluster-latest-kubectl-stable1-gce) which could delay release further. Let's see if we can get 1.24 out with a clean testgrid.

April patch releases [were also delayed](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/TZDoPS2C1IM) for the same reason, and should come out this Tuesday.

Release Team [Shadow Applications](https://forms.gle/X9R3SjToUyb5BqAi9) are open. Please [read about the shadow training system](https://git.k8s.io/sig-release/release-team/shadows.md) and decide if being part of the [1.25 Release Team](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/1875) might be for you.


## Featured PRs

### [#109471: etcd: Update to v3.5.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109471)

The etcd version was recently upgraded to 3.5.3. The update contains several changes, the most notable of which is the resolution of a severe problem that existed in the 3.5 branch and may result in a committed transaction not being applied across all replicas in the event of a server crash. If you are using the 3.4 version here are some more details related to [v3.5.3](https://github.com/etcd-io/website/blob/main/content/en/docs/v3.5/upgrades/upgrade_3_5.md). 


### [#109461: Go: Update Go to 1.18.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109461)

Last month, Go 1.18 was published, and Kubernetes was upgraded to the newest version. Because the v1.18 version was [rejecting SHA-1 certificates](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.18#sha1), this release broke [CSR validation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108910). The WebPKI has banned SHA-1 certificates for years now, and crypto/x509 targets a profile compatible with the WebPKI. Although the WebPKI has banned SHA-1 certificates, it has not banned SHA-1-signed OCSP responses or CRLs. Consequently, Go 1.18 is unable to verify some WebPKI OCSP responses and CRLs. This problem was fixed in the new 1.18.1 go release, however the entire scenario caused a delay in the new kubernetes 1.24 release. This means that if you're working on new 1.24 or 1.25 code, you need to [update go in your dev environment](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109484) now.

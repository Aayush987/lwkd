### [#109471: etcd: Update to v3.5.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109471)

The etcd version was recently upgraded to 3.5.3. The update contains several changes, the most notable of which is the resolution of a severe problem that existed in the 3.5 branch and may result in a committed transaction not being applied across all replicas in the event of a server crash. If you are using the 3.4 version here are some more details related to [v3.5.3](https://github.com/etcd-io/website/blob/main/content/en/docs/v3.5/upgrades/upgrade_3_5.md). 


### [#109461: Go: Update Go to 1.18.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109461)

Last month, Go 1.18 was published, and Kubernetes was upgraded to the newest version. Because the v1.18 version was [rejecting SHA-1 certificates](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.18#sha1), this release broke [CSR validation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108910). The WebPKI has banned SHA-1 certificates for years now, and crypto/x509 targets a profile compatible with the WebPKI. Although the WebPKI has banned SHA-1 certificates, it has not banned SHA-1-signed OCSP responses or CRLs. Consequently, Go 1.18 is unable to verify some WebPKI OCSP responses and CRLs. This problem was fixed in the new 1.18.1 go release, however the entire scenario caused a delay in the new kubernetes 1.24 release, which is due next month.

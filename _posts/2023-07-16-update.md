## Release Schedule

Code Freeze starts tonight (for folks in North America) or tommorrow morning (for everyone else).  Is everything checked in?  This is followed by the regular release countdown: open docs PRs by Thursday, publish deprecations blog on Thursday, test freeze and finalize docs next week. As always, once we're in Code Freeze, please respond to test failure issues with alacrity.

As if that weren't enough, patch releases are due out Wednesday.  This will be the last patch for 1.24.

## Developer News

Migrating the project's container images linked via k8s.gcr.io from gcr.io/google-containers to gcr.io/k8s-artifacts-prod has been [rolled back](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kubernetes-dev/MkXnkTSJ_vs/IeI3LgmDCAAJ) because we discovered a number of undocumented internal references the hard way.  The infrastructure team will be cleaning things up and retrying this migration sometime next month.

Project Zoom accounts have [been locked down more](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kubernetes-dev/tKC4cs8H0vA/55jtADovCAAJ): owners will need to use the Zoom app, and attendees will have to log in if they follow a web link.  Please remember to update your Zoom client, and follow the [Zoom guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/zoom-guidelines.md).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Start Enhancements Tracking, April 14**

The 1.19 release cycle has officially started, and [has a schedule](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.19).  We start tracking enhancements tommorrow, so update those KEPs; you have until May 5th to figure out what your SIG will work on this cycle.

The Release team is also [selecting shadows](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSflH3ZXwWJea5TRr9tunjv2yJmWHp4Z4oMnpLfpTpv-u9Lxng/viewform) for the various roles, so if you've always wanted to participate, here's your chance.  Deadline Tuesday.

## Developer News

Migrating the project's container images linked via k8s.gcr.io from gcr.io/google-containers to gcr.io/k8s-artifacts-prod has been [rolled back](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kubernetes-dev/MkXnkTSJ_vs/IeI3LgmDCAAJ) because we discovered a number of undocumented internal references the hard way.  The infrastructure team will be cleaning things up and retrying this migration sometime next month.

Project Zoom accounts have [been locked down more](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kubernetes-dev/tKC4cs8H0vA/55jtADovCAAJ): owners will need to use the Zoom app, and attendees will have to log in if they follow a web link.  Please remember to update your Zoom client, and follow the [Zoom guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/zoom-guidelines.md).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Start Enhancements Tracking, April 14**

The 1.19 release cycle has officially started, and [has a schedule](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.19).  We start tracking enhancements tommorrow, so update those KEPs; you have until May 5th to figure out what your SIG will work on this cycle.

The Release team is also [selecting shadows](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSflH3ZXwWJea5TRr9tunjv2yJmWHp4Z4oMnpLfpTpv-u9Lxng/viewform) for the various roles, so if you've always wanted to participate, here's your chance.  Deadline Tuesday.

Version 1.18 has its first update, [v1.18.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md/#v1181), that fixes a bunch of bugs.

## Featured PRs

### [#89912: Move scheduler's NodeInfo and Listers types to framework pkg](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89912)

A quiet week in PRs, one big set of improvements this week was to the NodeInfo type and surrounding code. This PR was the big one, a package swap that will need updating in most current scheduler PRs as well as things linking against the scheduler code. This was joined by [#90030](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90030) which did further cleanups to the API and made it more idiomatic Go.

### [#89652: Fix client watch reestablishment handling of client-side timeouts](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89652)

And then a client-oriented fix, avoiding fallback to full collection list on watch failures if there is a client-side timeout. As a separate server-side fix, [#89881](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89881) improves the behavior of watches during unplanned Etcd failovers.

## Developer News

Steering Committee elections are open! The [details have been posted to the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/1opNxmQBnA4) but the short verison:

If you want to stand for election, send an email to kubernetes-dev@googlegroups.com with the subject line "Steering Committee Nomination: Your Name (@yourgithub)". Anyone can run, you don't need to have any specific credentials, just three endorsements from active voters.

On the voting side, the current voter roll is [up on Github](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/events/elections/2020/voters.md). If you don't see yourself there and feel you contribute to the project in non-DevStats-visible ways, please fill out an [exemption form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/k8s-sc-election-2020) to be added.

If anyone has any questions about either running for the Steering Committee or about voting, you can reach the election team in the `#steering-committee` Slack channel or on k-dev.

Also this week is Kubecon EU. Despite being a virtual event, some folks may be less available than usual while preparing or attending talks.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.19 Release, August 25th (planned)**

1.19 currently has two blockers throwing off the release schedule.  First, the final release of 1.19 is tied to final [release of Go 1.15](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-nuts/c/HEQbseGb-jQ), which has also been delayed but is expected within a week.  Second, there are still [critical test failures/flakes unresolved](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3Av1.19+label%3A%22priority%2Fcritical-urgent%22).  The release team still plans to make the release date of August 25.

Patch releases 1.18.7, 1.17.10, and 1.16.14 are expected out Wednesday.

## Other Merges

* Ingress v1 `secretName` parameters [must pass the validation for secret names](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93929).
* [Reconcile Services](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93030) after a delete of a corresponding Endpoint to avoid stale caches.

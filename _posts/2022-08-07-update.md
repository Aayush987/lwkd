## Developer News

Starting sometime next month, [k8s.gcr.io will begin to 302 redirect](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/RArAjOlgLZ8) to registry.k8s.io, in order to ensure that old releases pull from the new, lower-hosting-cost, registry.

With 1.24 stable on Go 1.18, Kubernetes contributors are [officially allowed to use Go Generics](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/generics.md), although you should avoid them in any backportable bug fixes until 1.24 is EOL in late 2023.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Docs ready Aug 9; Test Freeze Aug 10**

We are in Code Freeze, and trying to wrap up 1.25.  This means that tests are frozen (no changes except to resolve CI bugs) starting this Wednesday.  You should also have your docs ready for review by Tuesday.  [The first beta is released](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md).

This Friday (8/12) is the cherry pick deadline for the next batch of patch updates to 1.22, 1.23 and 1.24.

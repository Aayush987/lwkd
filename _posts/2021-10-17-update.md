## Developer News

Voting in the [Steering Committee Election](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/elections/2021) is now open.  We have a record 13 well-known contributors running for the four available seats.  Please [cast your ballot](https://elections.k8s.io) and help choose who will lead us in 2022-2023. Polls close on Nov. 4.

SIG-Scheduling now has separate Tech Leads from Chairs, starting with [new TL Aldo Culquicondor](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/6162).


## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: November 1, exception requests due**

October patch releases were [pushed back](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/BMXtqVGR_n0) because of Kubecon, which means you still have time to get a cherry-pick in until October 22, for a release on 10/27.

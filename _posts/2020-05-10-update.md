## Developer News

The [Amsterdam Contributor Summit](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/jnPv42i2ACw) has been cancelled, and will not be held as a virtual version either in order to limit "virtual conference fatigue." The next contributor summit will be in Boston. The New Contributor Workshop is moving to an online-only version that should be ready sometime in July.

Kubernetes is [looking to move to distroless containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/70249) for many components.  This [may break many Flexvolume drivers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/78737), which can rely on Linux utilities to work. Please [participate in the SIG-Storage discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/kubernetes-sig-storage/618lBlJo8rU/wYkqMI-zAgAJ) if that includes your driver.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancement Freeze, May 19th**

[Version 1.15.12](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.15.md/#v11512), released last week, is the final patch for v1.15.  If you're still on 1.15, it's time to upgrade or get support from a vendor.  v1.16 will likely have extended support, but v1.15 does not.

Also, [v1.19alpha3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.19.md/#v1190-alpha3) is ready for your testing.

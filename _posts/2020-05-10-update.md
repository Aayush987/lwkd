## Developer News

The [Amsterdam Contributor Summit](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/jnPv42i2ACw) has been cancelled, and will not be held as a virtual version either in order to limit "virtual conference fatigue." The next contributor summit will be in Boston. The New Contributor Workshop is moving to an online-only version that should be ready sometime in July.

Kubernetes is [looking to move to distroless containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/70249) for many components.  This [may break many Flexvolume drivers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/78737), which can rely on Linux utilities to work. Please [participate in the SIG-Storage discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/kubernetes-sig-storage/618lBlJo8rU/wYkqMI-zAgAJ) if that includes your driver.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancement Freeze, May 19th**

[Version 1.15.12](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.15.md/#v11512), released last week, is the final patch for v1.15.  If you're still on 1.15, it's time to upgrade or get support from a vendor.  v1.16 will likely have extended support, but v1.15 does not.

Also, [v1.19alpha3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.19.md/#v1190-alpha3) is ready for your testing.

## Featured PRs

### [#87746: Support compiling Kubelet w/o docker/docker](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/87746)

Another big step towards treating Docker like all other runtime plugins, there is now a `dockerless` build flag which can make a `docker/docker`-free Kubelet. The [KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/20200205-build-kubelet-without-docker.md) goes into greater detail about the rationale, but the short of it is a desire to have a more unified flow within the Kubelet code to reduce the risks of differences in behavior, as well as generally having less code to maintain.

### [#90674: Switch core master base images (kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler) from debian to distroless](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90674)

Minimal images! Or at least much more minimal. This week introduced a new [go-runner tool](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90804) which takes the place of the older bash scripts for log file management, and container images based on the [Distroless project](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) and `go-runner`. This reduces both container size and security surface area by a lot, and hopefully will improve logging performance too! Hopefully this experiment will be a success and the rest of the images will join them soon. As mentioned above, please join the SIG discussions if this change will impact you.

### [#90843: Add support for TLS 1.3 ciphers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90843)

And finally a small but mighty change, adding support for several TLS 1.3 ciphers for clients which can use them. This was identified by the Trail of Bits security audit as part of a larger [request to improve our TLS](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/81145) by only supporting safe ciphers.

## Other Merges

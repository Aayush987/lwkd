## Developer News

[Registration](https://forms.gle/oAppmLDggEEGx5tz5) is open for the [Contributor Celebration](https://k8s.dev/celebration).  Join us for end-of-year fun with your peers.

Since Tim Pepper was elected to Steering, he'll be [stepping down from the CoCC](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/DAK1goxlKwM) and Carlos Panato will take his place. [Steering Liaisons for SIGs](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/bcySV5z0foA) are also changing. And just because of what happened in another community, we'll make it [clear that nobody is above the CoC](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/6247).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Docs PRs, release blog ready for review, Nov 23**

It's Code Freeze!  So a ton of things are happening this Tuesday, just before the Americans all vanish into food comas.  Both the Doc PRs and the Release Blog draft should be ready to review.  RC0 will be released.  Test jobs will fork, and the Release team will start watching the Release-1.23 jobs instead of Main.  If you are on Family Time this week, don't forget that any Feature Blog articles are due next Tuesday.

Also, [1.23 Beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md) was released last week.

Patch Releases: [1.20.13](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.20.md), [1.21.7](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.21.md), and [1.22.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md) are out, including fixes for EndpointSlice mirroring, API panics, iptables regressions, and too many disk mounts on Windows.

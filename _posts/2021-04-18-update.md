## Developer News

The Kubernetes [release schedule is changing](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/IxnWeVRIadM), to 3 releases a year, starting with this year.  Per the [KEP]()
 and [SIG-Release Meeting](), we will be releasing new versions of Kubernetes on the following tentative schedule:

* 1.22: August 2, 2021
* 1.23: December 14, 2021
* 1.24: April 12, 2022
* 1.25: August 15, 2022
* 1.26: December, 2022

Moving to 3 releases a year is expected to make things easier on the SIGs and the release teams.

Rogerio Bastos & Ari Lima discovered [CVE-2021-25735](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/ES_850GbJ1U),a security hole that allows bypassing some Admission Webhooks, now fixed in the latest update releases.

The Slack team has [deployed an "inclusive language" Slack Bot](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/5660), which is just there to remind you not to use exclusive language like "guys".  This is a bit of an experiment, so we'll see how it goes.

SIG-CLI plans to [overhaul kubectl exit codes](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2574) and would like your feedback.  Will this break your scripts, or fix them?

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.22 Release Cycle Begins this week**

The 1.22 Release Team has been chosen, and work on the release will start this week.  Expect calls for enhancements soon.

[1.20.6](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.20.md), [1.19.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.19.md), and [1.18.18](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md) are available.  Among other things, these fix CVE-2021-25735, so install real soon if you use Admission Webhooks.

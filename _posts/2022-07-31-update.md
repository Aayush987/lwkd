## Developer News

Per [KEP-2853](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-release/2853-k-core-branch-rename), 
the publication branch of the kubernetes/kubernetes repository will switch to "main" at Code Freeze for 1.26, 
which is currently planned for mid-November.

We would like to [update Golang to 1.19rc2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111254) for
1.25, but (per thread) it's breaking things in Kubernetes, so continue using 1.18 for the time being.

Code of Conduct Committee [nominations are open](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/Q-vjH-wYyKY)
through Thursday; nominate someone of sober judgement you know.

Gluster support, including all Heketi code, is being [removed from Kubernetes 1.25](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/xEND8HRgfHU) 
due to [lack of a viable CSI driver and lack of Heketi maintenance](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111485). If you are 
using Kubernetes with Gluster in production, please contact [Humble Chirammal](hchiramm@redhat.com)
before August 26th with your feedback on this removal.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Freeze, August 2**

Code Freeze starts *6pm PDT tommorrow* (or today, depending on your time zone). So if
you have an [open KEP](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lnft8598eIQsqBp8W6X_LwaqBNZViYssQoFgGS8aJ3g/edit#gid=1563708230), 
you have a day to finish up. After this 1.25 becomes
a march of other [deadlines](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.25), 
including docs, blog, and test.

make sure to comment on that PR before it merges.

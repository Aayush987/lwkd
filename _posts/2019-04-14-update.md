## Developer News

[Kubernetes Hound](https://cs.k8s.io/) allows you to search the whole code base, including by regex.  Among other things, you can search for [your name in OWNERs files](https://cs.k8s.io/?q=your-name-here&files=OWNERS&repos=), to see if you're assigned things you no longer work on.

Last week's Community Meeting had a [summary of Windows Container status and work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVze4sDNI_E). With full Windows support looming, developers should get [prepared to test on Windows](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/windows/).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, April 30th**

It's the [second week of 1.15](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.15), and the 11-week schedule means that Enhancements Freeze is sooner rather than later.  Have your KEP prepped and your issues filed by the end of the month.

Update release schedule:

* [1.14.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.14.1) released April 8th
* 1.13.6 is beta'd, and release is RSN
* 1.12.8's cherry-pick deadline is April 19, release 22nd
* 1.11 will have a final release this month, as 1.11.10

## Featured PRs

Slow development week last week, possibly because of Google Next.

### [#71136: Prune literally all kube-apiserver internal client](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/71136)

The slow burn down of internal clients has finally been completed. All client calls now use the standard client-go library rather than standalone internal copies. These were never a public API so any external code should be unaffected, but PRs in flight may need to swap to the correct client code.

## Other Merges

* check GCE logs for rotation [every 5 minutes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/76352)
* kubeadm now [works with more than one container runtime installed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/76505)
* stop Portworx from [crashing the controller manager](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/76341)
* remove cloud provider information [from the kubelet's `/spec` endpoint](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/76291)
* change kubelet probe metrics [to be counters](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/76074), and UpdateContainerResources [from `container_status` to `update_container`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75278)
* add [EachListItem util](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75849) to client-go for paging lists of objects

## Deprecated

Apparently it's all still good this week

## Version Updates

* [metrics-server to v0.3.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/76437)
* [cri-tools to v1.14.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75658)

## Featured PRs

### [Sort release notes by Kind(s) instead of SIG(s)](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/pull/923)

For the 1.18 release, the team will be experimenting with sorting changes by Kind instead of by SIG, in response to user requests.  Sascha Grunert has shared [an example of 1.17's notes sorted that way](https://gist.github.com/saschagrunert/80385c331a7e97ee408ce4f718594c5a).  If you have objections or concerns about this, comment on the PR before it merges on Thursday.

### [stop using ginkgo.flakeAttempts in e2e jobs](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/15516)

Several years ago, we set ginko.flakeAttempts to "2" in many e2e tests, even pushing an upstream change to ginko. This effectively allowed each test two tries to pass, as a hacky way to deal with network timeouts and other issues.  The setting also has given us an artificial confidence in how reliable a lot of code is.  

[That ends soon,](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/68091); it's already been removed from the release-blocking jobs.  This does mean that some of your tests that weren't [considered "flaky"](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fkubernetes%2Fcommunity%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fcontributors%2Fdevel%2Fsig-testing%2Fflaky-tests.md&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFI89VHXXiw00XCiKUPUGhyr9I1jg) before now will be -- fix them.

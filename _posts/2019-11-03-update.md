## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Freeze, November 14th**

Yes, we're freezing two days before the Kubecon pageantry starts.  After that, you need to cherry-pick to get into v1.17, so ideally finish up your work now.

The next [patch release date is Nov. 13th](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/patch-releases.md), for all supported releases, which does *not* include v1.13, since it's both EOL and removed from Testgrid.

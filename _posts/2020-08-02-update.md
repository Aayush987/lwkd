## Meeting Summary

Monday's [Steering Committee meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qazwMIHGeF3iUh5xMJIJ6PDr-S3bNkT8tNLRkSiOkOU/edit) started out by discussing [the dates for the SC elections](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/steering/c/1lRWHGbExe8/m/jLdf6Nr5BwAJ). Next, discussion of [the proposed SIG-Security](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/4962), which would replace the Security Process WG.  One of the main reasons behind this is providing a clear place for outside vendors and security folk to contact.  The security council will still exist for confidential handling of security reports/releases.

Paris asked [if working groups should do their own annual reports](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/172) in 2021, or if those should get bundled with the SIG reports.  Committees are getting [SC liaisons](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/issues/170).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Cherry Pick Deadline Aug 6th (theoretically)**

We're not in Code Thaw yet, though, due to [unresolved test failures and flakes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3Av1.19+label%3A%22priority%2Fcritical-urgent%22).  Please get those bugs closed, folks.  Also, 1.19 now depends on Go 1.15.0, which isn't released yet.

The cherry-pick deadline for upcoming patch releases is this Friday, for a minor release on August 12th.

## Featured PRs

### [test-infra#18471: force k8s-infra-prow-build jobs to be Guaranteed Pod QOS](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/18471)

All Kubernetes Prow jobs have been configured with resource requests and limits to ensure they run with the Guaranteed quality-of-service mode. This will help CI stability in the long run as test runs should not be subject to resource exhaustion however it does mean that if you are adding a new Prow job you will need to estimate the resources required and work with SIG-Testing to dial in the values. Also if you are expecting a change to dramatically alter the resource needs of a test job, please talk to SIG-Testing so they can help adjust the values.

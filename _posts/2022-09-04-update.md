See below about changes to the Enhancements process.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release schedule, team completed Sept. 9**

The enhancements team is planning to [use a project board](http://bit.ly/k8s126-enhancements) to track enhancements. This will [make the feature opt-in process different](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/R1afPL7zpT4) (and hopefully better): instead of adding your SIGs features to a spreadsheet, SIG leads tag them with the label `lead-opted-in`.

Cherry-picks for the next round of patch releases are due Sept. 9.  This update will involve [new golang versions](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/rlvRpp6WVVY/m/yF7eGkiSBQAJ?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer), again.

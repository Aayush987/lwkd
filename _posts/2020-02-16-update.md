## Developer News

Some [program details](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubernetes-contributor-summit-europe/program/program-details/) are up for the Amsterdam Contributor Summit; register soon because it'll probably fill up.

SIG-Storage has chosen [two leads and two tech leads](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/3fKOGaJ0KI8) so that they have better, broader leadership.

The LTS Working Group is [proposing to extend the patch period to a full year](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1497) starting with release 1.19.  The KEP is open, so now's your time to comment for, against, or with "don't forgets."

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Beta and Branch Creation, Feb 18th**

On Tuesday 1.18 becomes its own versioned branch for you to target.  Code Freeze is March 5.

[1.17.3](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.17.md/#v1173), [1.16.7](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.16.md/#v1167), and [1.15.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.15.md/#v11510) were all updated on February 11th.  The next patch releases have not yet been scheduled.

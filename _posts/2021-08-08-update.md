## Developer News

[Kubernetes 1.22 is out!](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/08/04/kubernetes-1-22-release-announcement/). In addition to [SecComp Profiles](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/clusters/seccomp/#enable-the-use-of-runtimedefault-as-the-default-seccomp-profile-for-all-workloads), Memory QoS, swap support, credential plugins, and SSA graduation, 1.22 [breaks a few things](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md#no-really-you-must-read-this-before-you-upgrade) you might have been relying on.  Particularly, check out the [deprecated (mostly beta) APIs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-22.  Get all the features and more in [the Changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md).

The Infrastructure Working Group is becoming [SIG-Infrastructure](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/5928) to better separate their work from Testing. As a major accomplishment, our [CI builds are now served](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/58lP-CIP2zg) entirely from community-controlled infra, a task Infra has been working on since 1.17.  So, now "I can't help with infra because I'm not a Googler" is no excuse at all.

The Code of Conduct Committee is [looking for nominees](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/yuNA5Zsj63U) to serve for the next year.
1.2
Michael Taufen would [like your feedback on his draft KEP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qX7FoXBxWrPfUD55IDQMyeDQMH-HzH8vSx6-WsLNr8o/edit?resourcekey=0-iLUGguVKXPeHMNDwEzBMbw#heading=h.foqb0s2snh9q) for Image Pull Authenication.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.23 Cycle Begins, August 23**

We are currently in the inter-release limbo period. Right now, the Release Team is picking shadows.

The cherry-pick deadline for the August patch releases was moved to August 16th, so you still have time to get those fixes in.

## Developer News

The [March Community Meeting](http://bit.ly/k8scommunity ) will be this Thursday.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Thaw, March 17th; Cherry Pick Deadline March 19**

We're going into Code Thaw now, so remember you need to tag any fixes with branch v1.18.  Your docs should be already complete (they are, aren't they?), and 1.18rc1 will be released on Tuesday.  Final release is still slated for March 24th.

All supported versions where just updated on March 12, including [v1.15.11](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.15.md/#v11511), [v1.16.8](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.16.md/#v1168), and [v1.17.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.17.md/#v1174).  Note that this release upgrades the required Golang version.

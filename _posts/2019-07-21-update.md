## Developer News

The [2019 Contributor Summit in San Diego](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/2019/11-contributor-summit) will take place from November 17th-18th, just before KubeCon San Diego.  Registration will open September 2nd, and the committee will be soliciting session proposals starting next week.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, July 30**

Currently the Release Team is collecting Enhancements, so get those KEPs up to date.  

Patch release 1.15.1 came out July 18th, so if you've been waiting for that, you can now upgrade to version 1.15.

## Featured PRs

### [Add Ephemeral Containers to the Kubernetes core API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/59416)

This is the first of three PRs to add support for [Ephemeral Containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/20190212-ephemeral-containers.md), also known as "distroless containers" or "debug containers".  These allow attaching a temporary container to a running pod for troubleshooting purposes.

This feature was originally proposed by Lee Verberne [in mid-2016](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/27140), and that PR has been open for 16 months.  Just in case you though *your* PR was taking forever to merge.

## Developer News

Dockershim is going away in 1.24.  Are you ready?  If you're a production user of Kubernetes as well as a contributor, please [fill out](https://forms.gle/svCJmhvTv78jGdSx8) the dockershim removal readiness survey as soon as you can.  Thanks!

We are testing [moving to EasyCLA](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/-mdBNXLYZ_Y) for CLA-signing.  Currently EasyCLA is giving lots of warnings, but it's not blocking your merge. If it doesn't auth you, [comment on the tracking issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/3068).


## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Freeze, Nov. 16th 23:59 UTC**

It's here! Tommorrow is [Code Freeze for 1.23](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/pqdD3S7rhy0), and it's time to decide if your feature is gonna make it or not. 23 of this release's [60 tracked enhancements](http://bit.ly/k8s123-enhancements) are "at risk"; of one of those is yours, you need to get in touch with the Enhancements team now. From here until the release, you'll need a milestone maintainer to approve anything that needs to go into 1.23.

The next patch releases are due out on Wednesday.

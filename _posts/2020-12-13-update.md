## Developer News

ICYMI, [Kubernetes 1.20 has been released](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/08/kubernetes-1-20-release-announcement/).  This particular release has 42 major enhancements, making it the most featureful release in a while, and probably the most disruptive as well.  Maybe use the holidays for testing instead of deploying it on Christmas Eve.  Just a tip.

The chairs of the [Component Standard WG are retiring](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/sQGrk6HWyj0) and are looking for new leaders for that WG.


## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.21 cycle begins, January 5th**

We are currently in the limbo period between the release of 1.20 and the start of official 1.21 development, otherwise known as "packaging up 1.20.1".  Expect an announcement of the start of 1.21 after New Year's, and even consider being a release team shadow.

[1.19.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.19.md), [1.18.13](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md), [1.17.15](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.17.md), were released last week. Primary fixes are keeping app pods from disrupting the kubelet on Windows, and fixing OOM issue on Linux kernel 5.1+.

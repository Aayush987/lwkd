## Community Meeting Summary

We kicked off the [community meeting](http://bit.ly/k8scommunity) with a demo of [tracing pod startup](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-vGwSAHYNFod2WURHLSXZtL-F2_7gvJcCSRXanW16Zs/), work done by intern Sam Naser. It utilizes a distributed tracing approach using OpenCensus libaries that is compatible with Zipkin.  In the future, they plan downward API exposure and instrumenting more objects; see the [KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/650) and [repo](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/mutating-trace-admission-controller).

Dawn Chen went over [SIG-Node's work](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17TtCtbZrPaPtv5xlIo0K-VKqooDNb6UIrcFMCwMre1k/), including a revision of the SIG's scope of responsibility, and adding RuntimeClass, a more efficient node heartbeat, and better Windows support.  OS/Arch labels and HugePages support are now GA, and they're working on Node-level isolation such as PID management.

For [SIG-API-Machinery](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1S9faDXJ_cs5oZlN74ysJVtytiCnBjoZliFBmt7mZEd8), David Eads mentioned their work in 1.13 on CRD Webhook conversion (please test!) and dynamic typed informers for dynamic controllers.  For 1.14, they're hoping to get admission webhooks GA and an alpha release of server side apply.  They're also deprecating swagger.json, as well as the alpha initializers.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: [Enhancements Freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.14#enhancements-freeze), Tuesday January 29th**

For this Enhancements deadline, all features are required to be related to a KEP.  Currently there are [41 listed enhancements](https://bit.ly/k8s114-enhancements), including 19 alpha features, 11 beta, and 6 GA ones.  Also, currently the list of CI signal jobs is being improved by applying the [release-blocking criteria](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/release-blocking-jobs.md#release-blocking-criteria) and [finding owners for all jobs](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/441).

Patch updates for 1.13 and 1.11 came out last week.

## Community Meeting Summary

Last week's [community meeting](http://bit.ly/k8scommunity) started with Ahmet Alp Balkan [introducing Krew](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TTSdInmHbchyAK6lzkVQCUpQNDJcxe6SZGEB5IfRq10/edit#slide=id.p), a plugin manager for kubectl.  Plugins for kubectl have been stable since 1.12, and Krew solves discoverability, installation, and updating.

Aaron Crickenberger explained [Project Boards](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/) to contributors and gave some tips on using them. SIG Testing is figuring out how to add automation around Project Boards.

Klaus Ma (SIG-Scheduling) detailed his [Coscheduling](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-scheduling/34-20180703-coscheduling.md) KEP, which handles services where all of the pods need to start (and restart), or none.

Speaking of KEPs, Stephen Augustus [gave the SIG-PM update](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IcrTbZCGlZGZKnBO6srYqPZiwGrDdUnacm7OlF5GM1o/edit?usp=sharing).  They're updating their charter, and expanding and detailing KEPs, including adding some tools. The [SIG-Autoscaling](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-autoscaling) status, from Marcin Wielgus, mentioned their work on faster HPA scaling, fixing pod priorities, and adding autoscaler support for the Alibaba Cloud. Bowei Du [talked about work in progress in SIG-Network](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13l5gb7MtieQkkMwUGAV5mxip_mGmgvI-_b41WLOhShg/edit), such as IPv6 and SCTP support, Custom DNS policy, and node-local DNS caching.  This year, they plan to tackle dual stack networking, an Ingress overhaul, node-local services, and multicast and Windows support.  They could use some help, so consider joining the SIG.

The Infra team has switched to [automated Github team management](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-dev/dwHkzW6QyTU) using peribolos.  They're also purging and rebuilding the Milestone Maintainers team.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Finalize Release Team, January 18th**

As a major change for the 1.14 development cycle, Release Lead Crickenberger wants [every enhancement to be linked to a KEP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BlmHq5uPyBUDlppYqAAzslVbAO8hilgjqZUTaNXUhKM/edit#).  There will also be *no* code slush period this release cycle.  The Enhancement/KEP deadline will be January 29th.

Update version 1.13.2 was [released last Thursday](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.13.2), and 1.12.5 will be cut this Thursday (Jan. 17th).

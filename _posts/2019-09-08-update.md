## Developer News

A quiet week as we have been in Code Freeze, but some solid progress towards 1.16! The [community meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VQDIAB0OqiSjIHI8AWMvSdceWhnz56jNpZrLs6o7NJY/edit#heading=h.1no1oai46pru) demo from Elijah Oyekunle showed off the new CRD support in the dashboard web UI. Most SIG updates were short or delayed until next week due to freeze.

We are in the last few days of preparation for the Steering Committee election. If you are not on the [list of voters](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/events/elections/2019/voters.md) and feel that you should be, please fill out [an exemption form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/k8s-sc-election-2019) ASAP (by September 11). Nominations to [stand for the election](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/elections/2019#candidacy-process) also close on the 11th. If you have any questions about the election, please reach out to anyone in SIG-ContribEx or come by `#sig-contribex` in Slack.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.16.0-rc.1 and Code Thaw, September 10**

We are entering the final week of the 1.16 release cycle, the home stretch! Please make sure to give as much time an attention as you are able to any CI issues that come up as we head for the final release. With Thaw will also come open season for 1.17 preparations so if you have an idea for an enhancement proposal, now would be a good time to start writing!

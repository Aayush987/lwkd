## Developer News

The project has created the #pr-reviews channel on [Slack](https://slack.k8s.io) as a place for you to get help with finding a reviewer for your pull request.

## Steering Committee Meeting

The [Steering Committee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qazwMIHGeF3iUh5xMJIJ6PDr-S3bNkT8tNLRkSiOkOU/edit#) had a public meeting last week.  They discussed the audit of WGs and charters (WG-ML may be converted to a UG), and [updated the SC charter](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/blob/master/charter.md). They will be contacting SIGs who need to update charters.  The cloud providers will all be moved under SIG-Cloud-Provider.

They also did more to clarify SubProjects, where we need roles and contact information for each, and document User Groups, which have been added to sigs.yaml.  We need more documentation around funding and resources from the CNCF and the CoC.

## Release Schedule

**NEXT DEADLINE: Docs complete March 18th.  Code Thaw March 19th**

Last week was [Week 10](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.14). This means that RC1 is due out next week, and release the week after that.  All enhancements should be done, and your docs are due now.

The Release Team is considering [migrating to Go 1.12.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/75372), which would delay Code Thaw and the release; watch kubernetes-dev for warnings.

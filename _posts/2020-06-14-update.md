## Developer News

The 1.19 release schedule has been changed, see below.

The Github admin team [asks folks not to rename the default branch](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/jvRPIscaDek) for community repos until they can plan how to make that work with automation.

Kubecon Boston CfP has [been extended to June 28th](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/cfp/).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Placeholder Doc PRs, June 19th**

To celebrate this Juneteenth, the Docs team says you need to open an initial PR for your new feature docs. Maybe do it early so you free up your Friday for other things.

The [1.19 schedule has been changed](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.19), with Code Freeze now on July 9, and Cherry Pick and Test Freeze deadlines on August 6th.  [Beta 2 is available](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.19.md/#v1190-beta2) for your testing.

Patch releases for all versions (1.16, 1.17, 1.18) will be published this Thursday.

## Developer News

Contributors, please remember to register for the [Kubernetes Contributor Celebration](https://k8s.dev/celebration).  Since we haven't had contributor summits this year, the Summit Team decided to hold an online social event.  Join and have fun.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Docs complete, Dec. 2**

Today starts Test Freeze (no new tests or non-fix test changes).  You should have submitted your placeholder doc already, our you'll hear from the release team on it.  [Beta 2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.20.md/#v1200-beta2) is available for your testing, and we're still planning on a Dec. 8 release.

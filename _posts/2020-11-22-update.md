## Developer News

Contributors, please remember to register for the [Kubernetes Contributor Celebration](https://k8s.dev/celebration).  Since we haven't had contributor summits this year, the Summit Team decided to hold an online social event.  Join and have fun.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Docs complete, Dec. 2**

We were already in Code Freeze, and today starts Test Freeze (no new tests or non-fix test changes).  You should have submitted your placeholder doc already, our you'll hear from the release team on it.  [Beta 2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.20.md/#v1200-beta2) is available for your testing, and we're still planning on a Dec. 8 release.

The next patch releases are due out the day after (12/9), with a cherry-pick deadline of 12/4.

## Featured PRs


## Other Merges

* API owner references [will be deduplicated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96185) before being stored

## Reversions

* The beta OS/Arch labels, which were deprecated and removed, [have been restored](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96810) until their absence stops making the scheduler fail
* [Request deadline timeouts](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96061) landed late and broke a bunch of tests, so they're being [punted to 1.21](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96727)

## Version Updates

* [node-problem-detector to 0.8.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96716) to detect OOMs on newer Linux kernels

## Developer News

There was a patch release this week that patched two security holes.  Update at the next reasonable maintenance window -- see below for details.

Kubernetes has [decided to start removing inactive contributors](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/AvCa-sGx9Jw) from Github org membership.

The switch from google-containers to k8s-artifacts-prod namespaces for Kubernetes' official containers [began Monday](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/Z-y1EK-XBQM).  Hopefully we've fixed all the obstacles.

SIG-Multicluster wants you [to choose what a multiple-cluster thing should be called](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/7K26ZGX).

SIG Leads need to [complete unconsious bias training](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/5gRUxPi5XxY) by August 31st.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Thaw (postponed)**

As of the time of writing there at 19 critical fix PRs open against 1.19, mostly failing or flaky tests. In light of this, the release team has decided to hold off on code thaw until CI signal for master looks better. If you have an open PR against 1.19 or a CI signal fix in general, please get them sorted as soon as possible. Similarly for reviewers and approvers, please take some time this week to make sure fixes are unblocked.


The target release date is in about 5 weeks and the whole team would like to ensure that we don't end up leaving build issues to the last minute, possibly destabilizing both the 1.19 releaes and master development.

1.18.6, 1.17.9, and 1.16.13 were released July 15th.  In addition to bug fixes, these updates patch [a privilege escalation security hole](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/zQTiWUTbPu0), and [a DDOS security hole](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/_Bj4WGISHNk).  While both holes require a combination of circumstances, infra hosts should plan to update very soon.

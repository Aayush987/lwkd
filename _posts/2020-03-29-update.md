## Developer News

![logo for 1.18 release](/2020/images/large-kube-collider.png)

[Kubernetes 1.18](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/03/25/kubernetes-1-18-release-announcement/) is out!  This release, coming out just a day late due to [an unexpected XFS issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89449),
focused mostly on advancing existing alpha features to beta or GA.  Advancing features include Topology Manager, Block Storage, Taint-Based Eviction, and Servside Apply.  New features include Kubectl Debug and Windows CSI.  Try it out today!

[Kubecon Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) has been rescheduled to August 13th, and will include a Contributor Summit.  However, the New Contributor Workshop is being transformed into an online-only experience; if you can help with this, speak up in #sig-contribex.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Assemble 1.19 Release Team**

With 1.18 out the door, Taylor Dolezal takes over as Release Lead.  New leads are being nominated and the team will open up for Shadow applications very soon.

Reminder: v1.15.10, v1.16.7, and v1.17.3 were released last week, [patching two security holes](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/2zG9IBPPj-I), so update now if you haven't already.


## Featured PRS

A couple of early features for 1.19:

### [add azure shared disk support](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89511)

Andy Zhang improved the Azure cloud provisioner to allow for disk resources that are shared between more that two pods.

### [kubelet: add initial support for cgroupv2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85218)

Among other things, [cgroups v2](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html) changes how resource limits are calculated and identified.  With this PR, Guiseppe Scrivano adds a code so that Kubernetes will use the correct value range depending on the cgroups mode on each node.  Expect more changes in 1.19 to fully support v2.


## Other Merges

* [Wait longer](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89589) for APIserver to come up in case of CSI initialization delays; could cause new kubelet to hang indefinitely, so will probably result in another fix later
* You can [use ServiceAccount Tokens](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89583) while the Pod they are bound to is pending deletion
* Fix [XFS mount issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89449)
* Lengthen backoff time [for EndpointSlice changes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89438)
* Make kubectl [pay attention to local port](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89401) in `port-forward` commands

## Deprecated

* beta.kubernetes.io/arch, deprecated since 1.14, to be [removed in 1.19](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89462)
* [kubectl drops all Heapster commands](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/87498) in 1.19

## Version Updates

* [Golang to 1.13.9](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89275) across 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19
* [etcd to 3.4.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89214) in 1.19
* [k8s.io/utils updated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89444) mainly for xfs mount

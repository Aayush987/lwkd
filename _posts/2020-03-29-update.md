## Developer News

![/2020/images/large-kube-collider.png]

[Kubernetes 1.18](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/03/25/kubernetes-1-18-release-announcement/) is out!  This release, coming out just a day late due to an unexpected XFS issue,
focused mostly on advancing existing alpha features to beta or GA.  Advancing features include Topology Manager, Block Storage, Taint-Based Eviction, and Servside Apply.  New features include Kubectl Debug and Windows CSI.  Try it out today!

[Kubecon Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) has been rescheduled to August 13th, and will include a Contributor Summit.  However, the New Contributor Workshop is being transformed into an online-only experience; if you can help with this, speak up in #sig-contribex.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Assemble 1.19 Release Team**

With 1.18 out the door, Taylor Dolezal takes over as Release Lead.  New leads are being nominated and the team will open up for Shadow applications very soon.

Reminder: v1.15.10, v1.16.7, and v1.17.3 were released last week, [patching two security holes](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!topic/kubernetes-dev/2zG9IBPPj-I), so update now if you haven't already.

## Developer News

Two security reports this week: [CVE-2022-3172](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/112513), which allows aggregated API servers to misdirect traffic and steal credentials, and [CVE-2021-25749](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/112192), which can let users deploy Windows container workloads as Administrator.  Both issues are fixed in the latest patch releases. Note that the patch for CVE-2022-3172 blocks all 300ish responses, so test after upgrading and be prepared to set `--aggregator-reject-forwarding-redirect`.

Ballots for the [2022 Steering Election](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/elections/steering/2022) are due September 29th.  Please [vote now](https://elections.k8s.io/)!

The [Contributor Summit CfP](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2022/kcsna/cfp/) is still open.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Production Readiness Sept. 29th**

Patch releases for [1.25.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md), [1.24.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md), [1.23.11](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md), and [1.22.14](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md) came out last week.  In addition to the above security issues, these patches fix a large number of bugs discovered during 1.25 Code Freeze and backported, as well as [updating Go for all versions](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112322).

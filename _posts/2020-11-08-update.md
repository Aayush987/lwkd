## Developer News

Kubectl [is moving the last bits to staging repos](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/tmUnaUQd7uk),
which means that contributions to kubectl need to move there in the future.

In order to [avoid accidental disclosure of private data](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/1753-logs-sanitization),
the Data Management WG
is [planning to add field tags across many APIs](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/Vbb5dZyduyc).  Comment now
if you have any feedback.

We're participating in the GitHub Kudos beta, so [thank a contributor today!](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/dslziTxFvDo)

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: CODE FREEZE November 12**

Working on a 1.20 feature?  Get your PRs merged by EOD Thursday, or get delayed
to 1.21.  If you need to postpone, the Release Team can change your milestones.
After this, it's all about getting tests to pass.

Patch releases 1.19.4, 1.18.11, and 1.17.14 are planned for Wednesday this week.

## Featured PRs

### [#94115: kubelet: respect exec probe timeouts](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94115)

A relatively small fix, correctly checking for timeout errors during an exec probe, however this change pushes the dreaded Correct But A Compatibility Change button. All Kubernetes users are advised to review their usage of `exec` checks in readiness, liveness, and startup probes to see if you have a timeout set that will cause your checks to fail now. A default-true `ExecProbeTimeout` feature gate has been added to restore the old behavior, however it will only be maintained until 1.22 so proactive action is recommended.

### [#96097: Introduce a simple datapolicy library](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96097)

As a follow up to the recent security issues with tokens being logged, we have a prototype for a data policy library, and a second PR [adding an example log filter that uses it](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96309). The hope is this can prevent future data leakage by tagging data at the struct level. Currently this is implemented in a highly dynamic way using `reflect`, so if your subsystems will make heavy use of it you may want to do some performance testing. If you have any feedback about the current implementation or questions about how to integrate with it, please contact SIG-APIMachinery or [respond on k-dev](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/Vbb5dZyduyc).

The heart of the new library is a `datapolicy:"type"` struct tag that will be used to mark struct fields that contain a certain type of sensitive data, such as `datapolicy:"password"` or `datapolicy:"apikey"`. A final list of standard type names has not yet been created. The data policy library exposes a `Validate()` method which takes any value and returns an array of all the data policy labels on fields in that object, recursively validating sub-objects below the one passed in. The simplest use cases can check if `len() > 0` and refuse to process or output the value, but specific types can be allowed by ignoring them in the array.

## Other Merges

* Add [the api-extensions category](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95603) to the API, for mutating admission configs, CRDs, and all the other customizable stuff
* RootCAConfigMap is [enabled by default](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96197), causing the controller to publish a configmap with APIserver connection certs to every namespace
* You can [set the size](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94444) of memory-backed volumes
* Since TokenRequest is now GA, [require a bunch of APIserver flags](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95896) for managing cert issuing
* Bypass kube-proxy [and use the Load Balancer directly](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92312) via `LoadBalancerIPMode`
* kubectl [warns you if a resource gets deleted](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95544) during `apply`, and if you [try to copy a nonexistant file](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90333) to a pod
* The APIserver [maintains a lease object](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95533) to [identify itself](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/1965-kube-apiserver-identity/README.md) for upgrades and migrations
* DefaultPreemption [evaluates a small pool of nodes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94814) in large clusters, speeding it up in cases when many nodes have preemptable pods
* The APIserver [will update storageversions](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93873) before serving write requests, permitting [safe storage migration](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/20190802-dynamic-coordinated-storage-version.md)
* EndpointSlices [get `serving` and ``terminating` conditions](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92968) so you can distinguish between an endpoint that's nonexistant and one that's shutting down
* etcd healtcheck timeout [is configurable](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93244)
* [Turn on `service-account-extend-token-expiration`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96273) metric by default
* Fix the [conntrack entry clearing bug](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96251) introduced by the last attempt to [fix nodeports](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/71573)
* APF metrics [all use snake_case](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96236)
* [Add a timeout](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96217) for TokenReview
* The Scheduler will [honor `LoclaStorageCapacityIsolation`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96092) (backported)
* Support [multiple Azure standard load balancers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96111) in one cluster
* Don't schedule pods [that don't have the right labels](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95812), even if they *do* have topologySpreadConstraints
* New e2e test to [validate the VolumeSnapshot finalizer](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95863)
* Internationalization cleanup [for kubectl commands](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95439)
* CRD non-nullable map fields [automatically get default values](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95423)
* kubectl diff [passes arguments to external diff tools](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95292)

## Promotions

* [`kubectl debug` to beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96138), replacing `kubectl alpha debug` (the `EphemeralContainers` feature gate is still alpha status)

## Deprecated

* StreamingProxyRedirects are [being deprecated](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1558), [starting by disabling `--redirect-container-streaming`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95935)
* `kubectl --delete-local-data` [is deprecated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95076) in favor of `--delete-emptydir-data`

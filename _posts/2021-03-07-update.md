### [#99012: Apply Builders for client-go's typed client](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99012)

While not completely merged at time of writing, this PR and [#99214](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99214) move us much closer towards typed server-side-apply support for client-go. All together these features solve a subtle but persistent issue with server-side-apply where using the normal API structs would make it impossible to know which non-pointer fields were or were not set. Similarly any `omitempty` field set to its zero value wouldn't be included in the serialized output at all. Both of these could be worked around by using Unstructured objects, however those have no type checks of any kind and are more than a little awkward to work with outside of simple template parsing. The new builder API keeps the type safety of the normal structs while still being able to record if a given field has been specified so that only those fields will end up in the final JSON.

A small example to add a label to the pods of a deployment:

```go
deploymentPatch := appsv1ac.Deployment("myapp", "default").
	WithSpec(appsv1ac.DeploymentSpec().
		WithTemplate(corev1ac.PodTemplateSpec().
			WithLabels(map[string]string{"app": "myapp"})

client := client.AppsV1().Deployments("default")
client.Apply(context.Background(), deploymentPatch, metav1.ApplyOptions{
    FieldManager: "mycontroller",
    Force: true,
})
```

Hopefully the rest of the PRs will land shortly.

### [#96600: Service Internal Traffic Policy](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96600)

Fine-grained control over node-level routing has been a big ask from the community since the early days of Kubernetes. While there have been complex workarounds involving host-network mode and Downward API usage this will now be a simpler first-class feature. Setting `internalTrafficPolicy: Local` will only route to endpoints on that node. Combined with a DaemonSet, you can now quickly configure node local caching, metrics shipping, or anything else where inter-node latency is best avoided.

### [#98812: Indexed job implementation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98812)

The Jobs system has long supported several modes of operation through the `completions` and `parallelism` fields. This new mode allows providing each underlying pod with an index number and running until each index has succeeded. This is a natural fit for things like hash-sharded CI tests, DAG tasks, or database management tasks mapped against StatefulSet replicas.

### [#98277: Add LoadBalancerClass field in service](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98277)

A smaller but potentially useful feature, LoadBalancer type Services now support a "class" field in the same way as Ingresses. This will allow for more experimentation with LoadBalancers as well as having multiple implementations running in parallel for different use cases.

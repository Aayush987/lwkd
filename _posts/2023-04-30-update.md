## Developer News

In Memoriam: [Carolyn Van Slyck](https://github.com/cncf/memorials/blob/main/carolyn-van-slyck.md), Kubernetes, CNCF, and Porter contributor.

Last week we held the [Kubernetes Contributor Summit](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2023/kcseu/), which included [many discussion sessions](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2023/kcseu/schedule/)([Notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1f-GChvcrbGW4TOOz2RTV6wRKOAyJRO-j)). Big takeaways from this include [the revival of the LTS Working Group](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/7259), as well as discussions on using golangci-lint and how we deal with having many repositories.


## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.28 Cycle Begins, May 15**

A new [release cycle is starting](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.28), with its associated deadlines and plans.  The first one coming up is Production Readiness freeze on June 8th.  In the meantime, happy hacking!

Shortly before Kubecon we released Patch versions [1.27.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md)(yes, already), [1.26.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.26.md), [1.25.9](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md), [1.24.13](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md).  These include Golang updates.

With the changes to the E2E testing framework, [you need to update how you write your tests](https://www.kubernetes.dev/blog/2023/04/12/e2e-testing-best-practices-reloaded/).  Good news, the updates make testing easier and more consistent.

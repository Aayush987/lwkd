## Developer News

After being elected to the [Steering Committee](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering), Nabarun Pal has stepped down from the [Code of Conduct Committee](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/-GkPSa00BKw), and Jason DeTiberius will be taking his place.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Exceptions due, Oct. 31**

1.26 is now in [Enhancements Freeze](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/U13asHGXMTE), with 21 new and 25 graduating features expected for the release (33 more dropped out).  If your team just missed the deadline, file for an [exception](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md) before the end of the month. Some of the interesting new enhancements include: 

* [Structured SLI data](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/3466-kubernetes-component-health-slis) that emit higher-level metrics
* View [logs from the Kubernetes components](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-windows/2258-node-service-log-viewer) using kubectl
* Add authentication extensions using [client exec proxy](https://github.com/nckturner/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/2718-20210511-client-exec-proxy)
* [Arbitrary ordinal numbering](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-apps/3335-statefulset-slice) for StatefulSets
* Adding hardware resources and plugins to nodes [at runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/3063-dynamic-resource-allocation)
* Change a Pod's resource requests [at runtime too](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/1287-in-place-update-pod-resources)
* Write custom admission policies [using a CEL](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/3488-cel-admission-control/README.md) instead of a webhook 

CI Signal is green.

Patch releases for all supported versions are expected out on Wednesday, including a [windows loadbalancer fix](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112840) and golang updates.

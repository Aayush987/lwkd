## Developer News

Contributors, please remember to register for the [Kubernetes Contributor Celebration](https://k8s.dev/celebration).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: All Documentation Finished: December 2**

We are still on-schedule for a December 8th release, so that means finishing your feature-related documentation by this Wednesday.  Also, respond to those test failure alerts ASAP!  1.20-RC-0 will be released on Tuesday (Dec. 1), so get ready to test.

Patch release cherry-picks are due December 4th for a planned patch release next week.

### Issues Needing Eyeballs

The following three test failure issues have not received sufficient attention as of December 1, and as such could still potentially block release. If you have knowledge or time to provide input/fixes for these, please get involved ASAP.  And please respond promptly in general to any new test failures this week.

Two of these are Windows test issues, so SIG-Windows, please weigh in.

* [Flaky Downward API Test on Windows](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/95226)
* [Windows container probe restart issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/94718)
* [Failing Bazel build run](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/96908)

## Version Updates

* [Update to go 1.15.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95776) in 1.20. Will probably be backported to 1.19 & 1.18 next week.

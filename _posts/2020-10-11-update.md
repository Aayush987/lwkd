## Developer News

Kubernetes' [newly elected Steering Committee members](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/10/12/steering-committee-results-2020/) are Davanum Srinivas, Jordan Liggitt, and Bob Killen. Thanks to all 312 contributors who voted.

The [October Community Meeting](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/x1xr7bSuzv8) is this week, featuring SIG-Instrumentation, Storage, and Service-Catalog.

The Reliability Working Group is tentatively approved, but needs work on their charter.  If you care about reliability, find them on the #wg-reliablity Slack channel or [kubernetes-wg-reliability group](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-wg-reliability).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Beta-0 released, Oct 27**

Enhancements Freeze is now in effect, so if you're still working on a feature to add, you have until Nov. 2 to file an [exception](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md) and see if you can still get it accepted.  Sooner is better.

Patch releases for 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19 are expected out this week; see below for some changes.

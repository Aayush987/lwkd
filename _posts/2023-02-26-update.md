## Developer News

**Image Registry Migration**: the old signing key, on [packages.cloud.google.com](https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg), 
has *stopped working*.  You need to use the new key on [dl.k8s.io](https://dl.k8s.io/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg).  The [community-images](https://github.com/dims/community-images) krew plugin will help you identify any remaining references to the old registry on your cluster.  It's not just users who need to update; 60 of our project's own repositories [still refer to the old registry](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/issues/4738).  Please check those resources and update as soon as you can.

[Registration](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2023/kcseu/registration/) is open for the Amsterdam contributor summit.  If you are [eligible](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/bilOfkuC_g8) and attending, please register as soon as you can, so that the summit team can get a headcount and you can get a hoodie.

Aravindh Puthiyaparambil has [been nominated as co-chair](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/AjKnnCrU1To) of SIG-Windows. Casey Davenport is [stepping down](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/15jJwPmBvnY) from SIG-Network, and has nominated Shane Utt to take his place.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancement Exceptions due, March 6**

It's still feature work time, until Code Freeze on March 15th, so keep working on finishing up those 1.27 enhancements.  It's also time to think about your tests passing, so please [check the new SIG-Release gating test policy](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/aac96fb/release-blocking-jobs.md#promoting-or-demoting-jobs).

Patch releases [1.26.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md), [1.25.7](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md), [1.24.11](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md), and [1.23.17](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md), are out, together with some changes to patch releases.  First, we're [no longer building an rc0 for patch releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/pull/2765). Second, we are building patch releases signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/), but [due to technical reasons](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/MwSx761slM0) were unable to sign all objects this patch release.  The problem will get fixed next month.

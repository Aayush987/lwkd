## Developer News

Tentative plans for the Contributor Summit around Kubecon in October include an on-site unconference-type event before Kubecon, and an online Contributor Celebration event after Kubecon. However, this is all very dependent on what the travel situation in October actually looks like.

Jim Bugwadia and Robert Ficcaglia have been [nominated as the new chairs of WG Policy](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/rsYcJQfGHV4)

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Exception Requests Due, June 28**

We're in the "write some code" portion of the release cycle.  And while you're writing some code, why not [write a feature blog or release theme too](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/g8pm9bg1-Lo)?

It's also time to Fix Your Test Jobs.  We have a total of [7 jobs not passing in Master-Blocking](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking) and [13 jobs not passing in Informing](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-informing), which include test fails and flakes from [almost every SIG](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/lpAsAFaBkj4).  So please get on diagnosing and fixing your team's fails/flakes, before this grinds 1.22 dev and patch release work to a halt.

Next patch releases are June 16th, provided that tests are passing by then.

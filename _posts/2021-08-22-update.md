## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, Sept. 9**

The 1.23 release cycle [began today](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/r2C1a86tuI0).  As always, [the call for Enhancements](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/SY4E4q-r_CA) is the first activity we'll see, and notably the [PRR Committee](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/production-readiness.md) would like to see the PRR part of your KEP a week before, on Sept. 2nd, if at all possible. 

[1.22.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md), with the first batch of post-release fixes, is now availble.

## Community Meeting Summary

Last week's [community meeting](http://bit.ly/k8scommunity) started with a demo of [kubetest](https://github.com/vapor-ware/kubetest).


## Release Schedule


## Featured PRs

### [#67547: Dynamic audit configuration API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67547)

The first half of a double-header patch, this PR adds in the API scaffolding and types for the [KEP 14 dynamic auditing system](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/keps/sig-auth/0014-dynamic-audit-configuration.md). The actual implementation of the system will follow soon in another PR. The end goal is a simplified system for consuming audit data, in the same was as the dynamic admission controller system allowed simpler and more flexible hooks into the authn/z layers.

### [#69883: Make CoreDNS default in kubeup and update CoreDNS version/manifest in kubeup and kubeadm](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69883)

Another step in the complex saga that is CoreDNS. The Network and Cluster Lifecycle SIGs are still confirming that things are on track for CoreDNS handling larger clusters smoothly, which is the biggest hurdle on the path to making it the default cluster DNS implementation. By making it the default for kubeup, the teams can gather more information about the at-scale behavior from our integration and e2e tests.

### [#69330: Add support for JSON patch in fake client](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69330)

The test API client used by client-go now better tracks different types of patch requests, allowing the testing of JSON Patch calls in both core code and other software using client-go.

### [#68441: Move versioned generators into their own package](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/68441)

One of [several cleanup PRs for kubectl](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69709), this should both reduce the interdependence of kubectl on `k/k` and also make it easier to add new generators to kubectl.

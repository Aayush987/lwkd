## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Exceptions due, March 21st**

While folks are working on features, CI signal [has gotten worse](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/5jIFMzlzWsk).  Currently there are 14 flaky jobs between master-informing and master-blocking, and there's even [one failing master-blocking job](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108307). This is not a good trend.  Please have a look at the [problem tests](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/68/views/1) and see if you can help.

The cherry-pick deadline for the next patch releases is March 11th.

## Developer News

The Java client for Kubernetes contains a [security flaw](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/uQmyI0qhNv4) which allows overwriting unauthorized files when using Copy on pods.  Upgrade to client versions 11.0.0/10.0.1/9.0.2 to fix this issue in your own Java applications.

The Production Readiness team plans to make [PRR approval required](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/5368) for KEPs in 1.21 and later.  [Discussion will ensue](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/8uI9q0Idy0k), partly because there are only 3 people on the PRR and it could become a bottleneck.

SIG-Node will tackle adding [swap support to Kubernetes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZtRtC8W8FwW_VWQLKP9DW_2H-hcLBcH9KBbukie67M/edit#) for 1.22.

Jeremy Rickard will be come a Technical Lead for SIG-Release.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, Feb. 9**

Kubernetes 1.21, led by Nabarun Pal, now has a [release schedule](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.21), including Enhancements Freeze on Feb 9ths, Code Freeze on March 9th, and final release on April 8th.  Start working on those KEPS!

SIG-Release will be updating kubernetes-dev with monthly (or more frequent) [status reports](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/q_UqG6ZnSA0).

1.20.2, 1.19.7, 1.18.15, and 1.17.17 patch releases are expected out on Wednesday.  Note that this is likely to be the next-to-last patch release for 1.17, so if you're running it, start thinking about upgrades.

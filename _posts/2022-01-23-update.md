## Developer News

Abdullah Gharaibeh has proposed [a new API for job queueing](http://bit.ly/kueue-apis), replacing the earlier [Job Management proposal](http://bit.ly/k8s-job-management) for your commenting pleasure.

Now that most Kubernetes components are using structured logging, SIG-Instrumentation would like to [talk about contextual logging](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3078) as a feature.  Like structured logging, this will affect a lot of components across the project.

We had a storm of spam on the mailing lists last week, so many Kubernetes lists are now moderated-first-post. Be patient with the delay when you first join a list.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: PRR heads-ups due, January 27th**

It's Week 3 of 1.24!  Your initial info to the Production Readiness team is [due this week](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/OjepOATqwD4), and Enhancements Freeze will follow a week later.

Enjoy the relatively benign [CI Signal Report for Week 3](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/d_t99Amq5-M).  Getting close to fixing all the tests that broke with the dockershim removal.

Patch Releases: [1.20.15](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.20.md), [1.21.9](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.21.md), [1.22.6](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md), and [1.23.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md) are out. This release mostly fixes various crash and performance bugs discovered since December.

This is the *last* update for 1.20, so schedule that upgrade now, eh?

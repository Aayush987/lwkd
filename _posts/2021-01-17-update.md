### [community#5413: Update PRR description based on community feedback](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/5413)

Following from last weeks discussion on how to handle Production Readiness Review for KEPs, the proposal for it to be mandatory has been reintroduced after some tweaking. This includes clear documentation on the process and how to volunteer as a PRR reviewer so the team can grow over time, reducing the chances of a review bottleneck. The updates to the PRR policies are still ongoing so please do check out the pull request and provide feedback!

If you are interested in joining the PRR team, please join `#prod-readiness` in Slack and check out review process guidelines in the document.

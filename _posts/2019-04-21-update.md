## Developer News

The Kubernetes project operates by GitOps as much as possible, so our [Slack configuration and channel management happens in GitHub](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/communication/slack-config), too.  Need a new channel, or to change owners or topics for an existing channel?  Submit a PR to kubernetes/community.  The tools that automate this are in [slack-infra](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/slack-infra), so if you like Slackops and Gitops: contributors wanted.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: [Enhancements Freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.15#enhancements-freeze), April 30th**

The [Release Team](https://git.k8s.io/sig-release/releases/release-1.15/release_team.md) is fully staffed and Claire posted [the schedule](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.15), so 1.15 is now fully underway.  This means that the Enhancements team have been collecting features and KEPs.  By April 30th, your feature or modification needs to be in the [enhancements repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3Av1.15+), likely with an attached KEP.

1.15.alpha1 came out last week, and release notes collection starts this week.

1.12.8 is expected out this week.

## Featured PRs

### [test-infra#9387: Disallow at mentions and keywords which close issues in commit messages](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/9387)

Due to issues with cross-talk between personal forks of `k/k` and GitHub's "helpful" close-issue-via-commit-message integration, we've now set up a Prow plugin to block at-mentions and those GitHub keywords from commit log messages. They are still allowed and encouraged in Issues/PRs, just not the commit messages themselves. The Prow plugin will explain all this again if you run afoul of its watchful gaze, but something to keep in mind.

### [#75474: add heartbeat inside watch](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75474)

An implementation of the Watch Bookmark KEP, this PR sets up a heartbeat system inside API watches which should allow for both faster resumption on reconnects as well as lower server load. As anyone with a large fleet of custom controllers reconnecting at once knows, this is going to help a lot.

### [test-infra#12308: Added Mermaid and SVG for Common Interactions Sequence Diagram](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/12308)

While the PR is relatively small, it gives us this lovely image to show the PR process in a nutshell:

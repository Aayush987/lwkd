## Meeting Summary

Last week's [steering committee meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qazwMIHGeF3iUh5xMJIJ6PDr-S3bNkT8tNLRkSiOkOU/edit#) started by discussing the API review process, primarily what it should and should not cover. Then discussed the problems with the [CIS benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/) for Kubernetes, which apparently make poor recommendations; SIG-Auth will be contacting them.  They also talked about Contributor Summit funding, and their first [formal funding request](https://github.com/kubernetes/funding/issues/3), which is not approved (yet).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancement tracking starts, July 12th**

It's time to start working on those KEPs for your 1.16 enhancements; look for a revised process to share them starting this Friday.

Patch releases for stable versions were delayed by an [issue with staging releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/issues/816), where improvements to the CI build tools caused blocking tests to fail and block all releases.

Several should be coming out this week as soon as that is resolved:

* 1.12.10
* 1.13.8
* 1.14.4

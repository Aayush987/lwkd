## Meeting Summary

Last week's [steering committee meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qazwMIHGeF3iUh5xMJIJ6PDr-S3bNkT8tNLRkSiOkOU/edit#) started by discussing the API review process, primarily what it should and should not cover. Then discussed the problems with the [CIS benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/) for Kubernetes, which apparently make poor recommendations; SIG-Auth will be contacting them.  They also talked about Contributor Summit funding, and their first [formal funding request](https://github.com/kubernetes/funding/issues/3), which is not approved (yet).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancement tracking starts, July 12th**

It's time to start working on those KEPs for your 1.16 enhancements; look for a revised process to share them starting this Friday.

Patch releases for stable versions were delayed by an [issue with staging releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/issues/816), where improvements to the CI build tools caused blocking tests to fail and block all releases.

Several should be coming out this week as soon as that is resolved:

* 1.12.10
* 1.13.8
* 1.14.4

## Featured PRs

### [#77819: Add a metadata client to client-go that can read PartialObjectMetadata](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/77819)

This PR implements the partial object API in client-go. This allows working with only the `metadata` section of objects. If running a new apiserver which understands the partial object metadata API, it will even send back just the metadata to save on encoding and transfer time. Without that new API, the client-go code will smoothly degrade to parsing the existing response data into the same `PartialObjectMetadata` struct. This is mostly targeted at custom controllers and scripts which are doing system maintenance and upkeep, working with objects in the abstract rather than the specifics of each type.

### [#71170: Cleanup math/rand package usage](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/71170)

After an earlier, unsuccessful pull request that made deeper changes to RNG usage, this PR is a more gentle approach. Most areas of the codebase can continue safely use `math/rand`, with more specific generators reserved for special cases. If you work on anything that uses random numbers, I would recommend reviewing the changes and matching the new style and structure if things have changes.

### [community#3777: Best practice for mailing list and github notification](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/3777)

And finally a short documentation PR, with helpful tips on setting up filters for Kubernetes mailing lists and Github notifications. Anyone contributing to Kubernetes for a long period of time has probably already had to set up similar filters, but for new contributors we can give them a head start with this guide!

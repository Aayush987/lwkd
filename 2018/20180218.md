## Community Meeting Summary


## KubeVirt Meeting Summary

[Native PV based storage](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/734) will allow KubeVirt to use any regular Kubernetes VP to store VMs. For now the support is limited to storing the VM image in the PV file-system mode (but for the future it is planned to support raw block mode as well). The PR is open, but a little bit blocked by reworking the demo and testing infrastructure to adopt to this change.

[Native Kubernetes networking](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/686) integration will allow KubeVirt to integrate VMs into the stock Kubernetes network without dedicated support from the underlying network plugin. After this PR is merged, a user will be able to access and expose VM based services in the same manner as regular pods.

[Network Device Plugin](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubernetes-device-plugins/pull/4) work in order to get network resources into a pod using a device plugin. Still early research but itâ€™s progressing.

# Week Ending January 28, 2018

## Community Meeting Summary

[This week's meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VQDIAB0OqiSjIHI8AWMvSdceWhnz56jNpZrLs6o7NJY/edit#) included two related demos, of [kube-exec](https://github.com/radu-matei/kube-exec) and [kube-toolkit](https://github.com/radu-matei/kube-toolkit).  Kube-exec is a demo tool which allows passing a command to run as a pod in a cluster from simple go code.  Kube-toolkit helps go developers create gRPC-based CLIs for Kubernetes.

Jaice DuMars, who recently replaced Phil Whitrock as SIG lead for SIG-release, discussed the 1.10 release with Ihor Dvoretskyi, the Features Lead.  See below for this.

Jeff Borek announced that IBM was willing to host SIG meetings for free at their [Index conference](https://developer.ibm.com/indexconf/) on February 20th; [contact him](mailto:jborek@us.ibm.com) for space ASAP if you want it.  Similarly, SIG participants were invited to [register for SIG meetings and deep-dives](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/kubernetes-dev/kohn%7Csort:date/kubernetes-dev/5U-eNRBav2Q/g71MW47ZAgAJ) at [Kubernetes Copenhagen](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2018/).  Finally, Kubernetes contributors need to [help staff the next Meet Our Contributors event](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/mentoring/meet-our-contributors.md) coming up on February 7th.

## Release Schedule

This was [week 4](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.10/release-1.10.md) of version 1.10 development.

Feature Freeze is January 29th, so by the time you read this, the [list of likely 1.10 features](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17bZrKTk8dOx5nomLrD1-93uBfajK5JS-v1o-nCLJmzE/edit?usp=sharing) should be complete.  Among the interesting features proposed are [moving CronJobs, formerly ScheduledJobs, to beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/19), [support for debug containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/277), and [infrastructure-aware Volume scheduling](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/490).  Look for a summary of 1.10 features in a future LWKD.

An alpha of 1.10 should be available on Tuesday, the 30th.

## Graph of the Week

![mentions-graph](/2018/images/mentions_graph.png)

The graph of the week was [mentions per SIG](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/dashboard/db/sig-mentions-categories?orgId=1&var-period=d7&var-sig=cli&var-sigcats=All).  This shows team mentions on Github, usually because someone wants a PR review.  Aaron Crickenberger introduced this graph because he personally feels that there are way too many Github teams; with 18 teams per SIG, the Kubernetes namespace has more than 290 teams.  His suggestion was that the project could weed out the teams that are not frequently used.
